# 404 Fixes Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-06-19  
**Purpose:** Resolve identified 404 errors on the locomotion data standardization website

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing `/versions.json` - FIXED âœ…

**Problem:** Both mkdocs configurations use mike versioning provider but no versions.json file existed anywhere in the repository.

**Solution:** Created versions.json files in multiple locations to ensure they're found:
- `/versions.json` (root level)
- `/docs/versions.json` (docs directory)
- `/docs/user_guide/versions.json` (user guide directory)

**Content:** Standard versioning structure with "latest" and "1.0.0" versions.

### 2. Announcement Banner Link Mismatch - FIXED âœ…

**Problem:** Root mkdocs.yml announcement banner pointed to `getting_started/quick_start/` but the actual site structure uses different paths.

**Solution:** Updated announcement link in root mkdocs.yml to point to correct path:
```yaml
# OLD
text: "ðŸš€ New to biomechanical data analysis? Start with our <a href='getting_started/quick_start/'>10-minute Quick Start</a> guide!"

# NEW  
text: "ðŸš€ New to biomechanical data analysis? Start with our <a href='user_guide/docs/getting_started/quick_start/'>10-minute Quick Start</a> guide!"
```

### 3. Missing `/examples/research/gait_analysis/` - FIXED âœ…

**Problem:** Referenced path in navigation didn't exist, causing 404s.

**Solution:** 
- Created new file: `/docs/user_guide/docs/examples/research/gait_analysis.md`
- Content provides navigation to existing research case studies
- Acts as a landing page that redirects to the comprehensive case studies content
- Added proper navigation structure in both mkdocs.yml files

### 4. Enhanced Navigation Structure - IMPROVED âœ…

**Problem:** Navigation inconsistencies between the two mkdocs configurations.

**Solution:** 
- Added "Examples" section to user_guide mkdocs.yml navigation
- Included proper hierarchical structure for research applications
- Aligned root mkdocs.yml navigation to match actual content structure
- Added versioning default settings to user_guide mkdocs.yml

## Files Modified

### Created Files:
1. `/versions.json`
2. `/docs/versions.json` 
3. `/docs/user_guide/versions.json`
4. `/docs/user_guide/docs/examples/research/gait_analysis.md`

### Modified Files:
1. `/mkdocs.yml` - Fixed announcement banner link and added gait analysis navigation
2. `/docs/user_guide/mkdocs.yml` - Added Examples section, enhanced versioning config

## Verification

All key 404 paths should now resolve:

### âœ… Fixed Paths:
- `/versions.json` â†’ Now exists in multiple locations
- `/getting_started/quick_start/` â†’ Announcement banner now points to correct path
- `/examples/research/gait_analysis/` â†’ New landing page created with proper navigation

### ðŸ”„ Navigation Improvements:
- Enhanced discoverability of research examples
- Better hierarchical organization
- Consistent linking between configurations

## Technical Details

### Mike Versioning Configuration
- Added `default: latest` to user guide configuration
- Created standard version structure with aliases
- Ensures version selector works properly

### Content Strategy
- `gait_analysis.md` serves as navigation hub pointing to comprehensive `case_studies.md`
- Maintains content quality by reusing existing detailed research examples
- Provides clear path for users looking for gait analysis content

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Site Building:** The actual site needs to be rebuilt for changes to take effect
2. **Link Testing:** After rebuild, verify all links resolve correctly
3. **Mike Deployment:** If using mike for versioning, ensure proper deployment configuration

## Next Steps

1. Rebuild the documentation site using the appropriate mkdocs configuration
2. Test all fixed links to ensure they resolve correctly
3. Consider consolidating the two mkdocs configurations if only one is needed
4. Update any hardcoded references to old paths that might exist elsewhere
