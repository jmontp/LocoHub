You should verify all the docs [standard_spec.md](mdc:docs/standard_spec/standard_spec.md), [phase_calculation.md](mdc:docs/standard_spec/phase_calculation.md), [sign_conventions.md](mdc:docs/standard_spec/sign_conventions.md), [units_and_conventions.md](mdc:docs/standard_spec/units_and_conventions.md), [consolidated_test_matrix.md](mdc:docs/standard_spec/consolidated_test_matrix.md), [task_definitions.md](mdc:docs/standard_spec/task_definitions.md) to ensure that you are following the docuemntation properly. If you have any doubts, or any point in the documentation is ambiguous, you should call the @interactive-feedback-mcp mcp server to clarify intent. In the case that the documentation was lacking, we should update the docs based on the user feedback provided from the @interactive-feedback-mcp mcp tool call.
