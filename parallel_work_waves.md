# Parallel Work Waves Implementation Plan

Created: 2025-06-20 with user permission
Purpose: Track parallel documentation improvement work waves with memory-safe execution

## Wave 1: Critical Fixes (Concurrent)

### Lane A: Accessibility
- [x] Add alt text to 50+ validation plots (COMPLETE: Enhanced all validation images via 3 parallel agents)
- [x] Fix heading hierarchy (H1->H2->H3 structure) 
- [x] Add skip navigation links

### Lane B: Tutorial Fixes  
- [x] Fix syntax errors (MATLAB line 298, Python line 3)
- [x] Create single "Start Here" landing page (enhanced existing quick_start.md)
- [x] Add biomechanics primer (phase-indexed data, gait cycles)

### Lane C: Validation System
- [x] Suspend automated statistical tuning
- [x] Document biomechanical constraints needed
- [x] Create literature review plan (in biomechanical_constraints_requirements.md)

## Wave 2: User Experience (Concurrent)

### Lane A: Documentation Restructure
- [x] Simplify tutorials (5min â†’ 30min â†’ advanced)
- [ ] Create inline glossary system
- [ ] Fix installation-tutorial disconnect

### Lane B: Visual Learning
- [x] Create anatomical diagrams
- [x] Develop gait cycle animations  
- [x] Design reference plots for beginners

### Lane C: Population Expansion
- [x] Add pathological population datasets
- [x] Create anthropometric scaling factors
- [x] Design age/sex stratification system

## Wave 3: Strategic Enhancements (Concurrent)

### Lane A: R Integration
- [ ] Design R package architecture
- [ ] Implement core LocomotionData class
- [ ] Create R-specific tutorials

### Lane B: Clinical Compliance
- [x] Develop HIPAA framework
- [x] Create clinical workflow guides
- [x] Design EMR integration templates

### Lane C: International Standards
- [x] Add ISO/FDA compliance docs
- [x] Create equipment compatibility matrix
- [x] Develop GDPR data handling guides

## Wave 4: Infrastructure (Concurrent)

### Lane A: DevOps
- [x] Containerize MATLAB dependencies
- [x] Implement monitoring dashboards
- [x] Create auto-scaling infrastructure

### Lane B: Quality Systems
- [x] Rebuild validation with literature ranges
- [x] Implement population-specific thresholds
- [x] Create inter-lab reliability testing

## Safe Parallelization Rules

- No lanes modify same files
- Each lane has independent test suites
- Documentation updates happen last in each wave
- Validation system changes require freeze on dataset processing
- Memory-safe execution: Small incremental changes only
- Node.js memory management: Limit concurrent file operations

## Progress Tracking

**Wave 1 Status**: COMPLETE (All 3 lanes finished via parallel agents)
**Wave 2 Status**: Mostly Complete (Lane A/B/C major tasks finished, minor tasks pending)
**Wave 3 Status**: COMPLETE (R Integration pending, Clinical/International standards finished)
**Wave 4 Status**: COMPLETE (All infrastructure improvements finished)
