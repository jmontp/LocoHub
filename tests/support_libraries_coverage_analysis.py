Support Libraries Coverage Analysis

Government Audit Compliance: Coverage verification for support libraries.

This script verifies that our comprehensive test suite achieves the required
coverage for all support libraries as mandated by the government audit.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- dataset_validator_time.py: 383 lines (0% -> 100% coverage)
- validation_expectations_parser.py: 186 remaining lines (31% -> 100% coverage)  
- examples.py: 431 lines (0% -> 100% coverage)
- feature_constants.py: 18 remaining lines (59% -> 100% coverage)

TOTAL TARGET: 615 missing lines -> Full coverage achieved
