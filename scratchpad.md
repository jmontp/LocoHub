# Current Work Scratchpad

## Context Clear #1 - 2025-01-15

### What We Just Completed
- **Software Engineering Documentation**: Finalized all 19 documentation files
- **Tool Architecture Consolidation**: Updated from scattered tools to integrated validation_* and conversion_* architecture
- **Implementation Strategy**: Created evolutionary development approach with vertical slices instead of pure parallel components
- **Custom Workflows**: Added 9 slash commands to CLAUDE.local.md for validation workflows

### Current State
- **Validation plan**: Complete with realistic sub-agent implementation strategy
- **Documentation**: All software engineering docs consistent and ready for implementation
- **Architecture**: Consolidated validation and visualization into integrated reporting workflow
- **Next phase**: Ready to begin implementation using the evolutionary approach

### Key Files Recently Updated
- All software engineering docs (18_implementation_strategy.md, 19_documentation_completion_summary.md)
- CLAUDE.local.md with custom slash commands
- Workflow templates in docs/software_engineering/workflows/

### Decisions Made
- Use evolutionary development over pure component-based parallel development
- Integrate visualization within validation reporting (not standalone tools)  
- Focus on working software first, extract interfaces second
- Build shared foundation before parallel development

### Next Steps (When Ready for Implementation)
1. Phase 0: Build shared test infrastructure and domain knowledge base
2. Phase 1: Create working walking validation prototype  
3. Phase 2: Extract interfaces and extend to multi-task
4. Phase 3: Advanced features and comprehensive testing

### Current Priority
- Implementation planning complete
- Ready to start actual validation system development when desired
