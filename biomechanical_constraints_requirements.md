# Biomechanical Constraints Requirements

Created: 2025-06-20 with user permission
Purpose: Document required biomechanical validation constraints before resuming automated tuning

## Critical Issues Identified

The automated statistical tuning system was suspended due to:
- 77% overall validation failure rate indicating inappropriate thresholds
- Purely statistical methods without biomechanical domain validation
- No population stratification (age, sex, BMI considerations)
- Violation of anatomical limits (e.g., negative knee flexion acceptance)

## Required Biomechanical Constraints

### 1. Anatomical Limits
- Joint angle ranges must respect anatomical limits
- Knee flexion: -5° to 120° (slight hyperextension to full flexion)
- Hip flexion: -15° to 130° (extension to full flexion)
- Ankle dorsiflexion: -30° to 30° (plantarflexion to dorsiflexion)

### 2. Literature-Based Reference Ranges
Before implementing statistical refinement:
- Compile reference ranges from biomechanics literature
- Include population-specific variations (age, sex, pathology)
- Document source studies and sample characteristics

### 3. Population Stratification
- Age groups: Young adult (18-35), Middle-aged (36-65), Elderly (65+)
- Sex-specific ranges where literature supports differences
- BMI considerations for ground reaction forces and joint moments
- Pathological vs healthy population distinctions

### 4. Task-Specific Constraints
- Walking speed effects on joint angles and moments
- Incline/decline walking modifications
- Stair climbing biomechanical differences

## Implementation Requirements

### Phase 1: Literature Review
- Systematic review of gait analysis reference ranges
- Meta-analysis of normal values across populations
- Documentation of measurement uncertainty and variability

### Phase 2: Constraint Integration
- Implement anatomical limit checking
- Add literature-based range initialization
- Create population-specific validation modules

### Phase 3: Statistical Refinement
- Apply statistical methods within biomechanical constraints
- Use Bayesian approaches incorporating prior knowledge
- Implement mixed-effects modeling for population variations

## Validation Framework

Before resuming automated tuning:
1. All ranges must pass anatomical plausibility checks
2. Literature-based justification required for all thresholds
3. Population stratification implemented where appropriate
4. Validation failure rates <5% for properly formatted datasets

## Next Steps

1. Complete literature review for kinematic and kinetic ranges
2. Implement biomechanical constraint checking system
3. Test new validation framework on existing datasets
4. Resume automated tuning with proper constraints integrated
