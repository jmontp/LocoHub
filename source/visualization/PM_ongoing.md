1. **Validation Library Refactor** - Moved plotting modules to validation library and cleaned interfaces
   - Moved filters_by_phase_plots.py and forward_kinematics_plots.py to source/validation/

   - Updated docstrings to clarify library usage with proper entry point documentation
   - Integrated step classifier color-coding functionality for validation plot overlays
   - Maintained backward compatibility while improving code organization

2. **Plotting Module Cleanup** - Removed non-plotting code from visualization modules
