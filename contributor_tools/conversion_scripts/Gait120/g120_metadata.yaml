# Dataset information
title: "Comprehensive Human Locomotion and Electromyography Dataset: Gait120"
institution: "KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology)"
description: |
  Large-scale human locomotion dataset with 120 healthy male subjects (ages 20-59)
  performing 7 tasks. Includes full-body joint kinematics from OpenSim inverse
  kinematics. Force plate data available for level walking and sit-stand tasks
  (subjects S011-S120 only).

  NOTE: Current conversion includes only 10 subjects (S001-S010) as a partial
  release. Full 120-subject conversion is pending download completion.

subject_count: 120  # Full dataset; current conversion has 10
subject_demographics: "Healthy males, ages 20-59"

# Data collection
data_collection:
  motion_capture: "Optical motion capture system"
  force_plates: "Force plates (level walking, sit-stand tasks only)"
  emg: "12-channel sEMG on right lower limb (not included in parquet)"
  model: "Modified Rajagopal model (OpenSim v4.0)"

# Tasks
tasks:
  - level_walking
  - stair_ascent
  - stair_descent
  - incline_walking
  - decline_walking
  - sit_to_stand
  - stand_to_sit

# Data notes
notes: |
  - Joint angles computed via OpenSim inverse kinematics
  - Knee angle sign convention converted (source: extension+, output: flexion+)
  - Force plate data missing for S001-S010 (calibration issue)
  - EMG data available in source but not included in parquet conversion
  - Full-body bilateral kinematics available
