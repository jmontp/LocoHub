  Dataset from "Task-agnostic exoskeleton control via biological joint moment estimation" (Nature 2024).
  Contains comprehensive biomechanical data from 25 able-bodied adults performing 28 different activities
  while wearing a clothing-integrated hip exoskeleton. Includes joint kinematics, kinetics, ground reaction
  forces, and exoskeleton sensor data collected at 200 Hz across three collection phases.

  Data collection occurred in three phases: Phase 1 (BT01-BT12) with unpowered exoskeleton and some
  heuristic controller trials, Phase 2 (BT13-BT17) with preliminary neural network model, and Phase 3
  (BT01, BT02, BT13, BT18-BT24) as validation with final model. Subjects performed 28 activities including
  treadmill walking (0.6-2.5 m/s), incline/decline walking (5-10 deg), stairs, backward walking,
  sit-to-stand, squats, jumping, lunges, and cutting maneuvers.
notes: >
  Gait cycles detected using vertical GRF threshold crossing (20 N). First 2 and last 1 strides per
  trial excluded as transitions. IQR-based filtering removes outlier stride durations. Biological
  moments (exoskeleton torque subtracted) used when available. Data phase-normalized to 150 points
  per gait cycle. Source data available at Georgia Tech Digital Repository:
