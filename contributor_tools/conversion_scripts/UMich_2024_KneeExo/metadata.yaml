description: |
  Dataset from "A Versatile Knee Exoskeleton Mitigates Quadriceps Fatigue
  in Lifting, Lowering, and Carrying Tasks" (Science Robotics 2024). Contains
  ensemble-averaged biomechanical data from 10 able-bodied adults performing
  lifting-lowering-carrying (LLC) tasks while wearing a bilateral knee exoskeleton.
  Includes knee kinematics, segment angles, exoskeleton torque, and ground reaction forces.

protocol: |
  Data collected from 10 able-bodied participants performing fatiguing and
  non-fatiguing lifting-lowering-carrying (LLC) tasks with a bilateral knee exoskeleton.
  Tasks include squat lift-lower, level walking, stair ascent/descent (7 inch steps),
  and ramp ascent/descent (15 degrees). Data is ensemble-averaged across subjects
  and cycles, normalized to 0-100% task cycle.
notes: |
  Source data is already ensemble-averaged (101 points per cycle), resampled
  to 150 points for standardized format. Only knee angle available (no hip/ankle).
  Exoskeleton torque stored in custom column (exo_torque_knee_ipsi_Nm). GRF is
  body-weight normalized. Data repository: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.z34tmpgks
