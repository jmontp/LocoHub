# Website Style Guide

Principles to keep docs consistent and useful for researchers.

## Audience & Tone
- Audience: grad students and researchers doing analysis today.
- Tone: practical, concise, example-first. Avoid marketing fluff.

## Information Architecture
- Keep nav depth to 1–2 levels. Prefer landing pages that link inward.
- Raw data first, then library usage as an alternative.
- Put “What the data looks like” high on key pages.
- Cross-link specs: standard, tasks, naming/units, validation ranges.

## Page Structure
- Start with a one-line purpose statement.
- Show a minimal, copy-paste example next.
- Use tabs for alternatives (labels must be “Using Raw Data” and “Using Library”).
- Use lists over prose; keep sections short (3–6 bullets).

## Visuals & Components
- Avoid big hero banners; prefer simple headings and code.
- Use tables sparingly; keep wide tables horizontally scrollable.
- Use admonitions for notes/tips only when they add clear value.

## Writing Conventions
- Variable names and units per spec; prefer radians and SI.
- Consistent headings: Title Case for H1/H2, sentence case elsewhere.
- Link to canonical docs instead of duplicating content.

## Technical Conventions
- Tabs default to “Using Raw Data” (site-wide default is ‘raw’).
- Keep code blocks runnable; include imports and minimal setup.
- Prefer relative links within docs; keep external links stable.

## Checklist for New/Updated Pages
- Has a clear H1 and one-line purpose
- Shows a minimal raw-data example
- Provides library alternative (if applicable)
- Links to relevant specs/reference
- Avoids unnecessary depth/duplicate content
