# Dataset Validation Reports

Comprehensive validation reports for all standardized locomotion datasets.

## Available Reports

### UMich 2021 Dataset Validation
- [Phase-indexed Validation Report](umich_2021_phase_validation_report.md)
- Comprehensive analysis of 8,305 gait cycles across walking tasks
- Validation success rates and detailed failure analysis
- Visual validation plots for kinematic and kinetic data

## Understanding Validation Reports

Dataset validation reports provide:

**Summary Statistics:**
- Total steps/cycles validated
- Success/failure rates by task
- Overall data quality metrics

**Visual Validation:**
- Phase-based validation plots showing expected vs actual data ranges
- Kinematic and kinetic validation charts by task
- Data distribution visualizations

**Detailed Analysis:**
- Variable-specific failure analysis
- Phase-specific validation issues
- Recommendations for data quality improvement

## Validation Plot Images

The validation reports include detailed plots showing:

- **Kinematic Validation**: Joint angle ranges across gait cycle phases
- **Kinetic Validation**: Force and moment patterns across gait cycle phases
- **Data Distribution**: Statistical analysis of variable ranges and outliers

These plots help identify data quality issues and guide dataset refinement.
