        if not self.is_factual_data(field):
            raise RectificationError("Cannot rectify derived/analyzed data")
            
        # Create audit trail
        rectification_record = {
            'participant_id': participant_id,
            'field': field,
            'old_value': old_value,

        # Update data
        self.update_participant_data(participant_id, field, new_value)
        
        # Log rectification
        self.log_rectification(rectification_record)

## Compliance Monitoring and Auditing

### Regular Compliance Checks

#### Monthly Reviews

**Consent Management Audit**:
```python
class ConsentAudit:
    def monthly_consent_review(self):
        """Perform monthly consent compliance review"""
        
        checks = {
            'expired_consents': self.check_expired_consents(),
            'withdrawal_processing': self.check_withdrawal_compliance(),
            'consent_scope_violations': self.check_scope_compliance(),
            'documentation_completeness': self.check_consent_documentation()
        }
        
        return self.generate_compliance_report(checks)
    
    def check_expired_consents(self):
        """Identify processing based on expired consents"""
        expired = self.db.query("""
            SELECT participant_id, consent_date, purposes
            FROM consent_records 
            WHERE consent_date < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 2 YEAR)
            AND withdrawal_timestamp IS NULL
        """)
        
        return expired
```

#### Quarterly Assessments

**Data Protection Impact Assessment Review**:
- Processing activity changes
- New risk identification
- Safeguard effectiveness
- Stakeholder feedback

#### Annual Audits

**Comprehensive Compliance Review**:
- Legal basis validity
- Consent management effectiveness
- Technical safeguard adequacy
- Training program effectiveness
- Incident response performance
