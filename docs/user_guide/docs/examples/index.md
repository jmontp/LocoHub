### Case Study: Stair Climbing Biomechanics
Complete research-level analysis of stair climbing adaptations:

<div class="case-study-preview" markdown>
**Research Question**: What biomechanical adaptations occur during stair climbing compared to level walking?

**Key Findings**:
- 85° peak knee flexion (vs 65° walking) - 31% increase
- 1.5 Nm/kg peak knee moments (vs 0.8 Nm/kg) - 88% increase  
- 2.5 W/kg power generation requirement - 3x walking demands

**Clinical Implications**: Quantified functional demands for rehabilitation planning

Advanced statistical techniques for biomechanical research:

<div class="analysis-preview" markdown>
```python
# One-way ANOVA with post-hoc comparisons
f_stat, p_val = stats.f_oneway(*groups)
pairwise_results = run_posthoc_tests(groups)
effect_sizes = calculate_cohens_d(groups)
```

**Advanced Features:**
- ANOVA with effect size calculations
- Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests
