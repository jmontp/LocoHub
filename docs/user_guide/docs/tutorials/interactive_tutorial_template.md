### 5. Hands-on Practice Sections
```markdown
### 🛠️ **Try It Yourself**

**Challenge:** Modify the code to analyze different biomechanical features.

**Instructions:**
1. Replace `knee_flexion_angle_rad` with `hip_flexion_angle_rad`
2. Change the plot title to reflect the new feature
3. Save the plot with a new filename

**Hint:** Look for lines containing `knee_flexion` and update them.
