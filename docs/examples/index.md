## :material-frequently-asked-questions: Frequently Asked Questions

??? question "Can I use these examples with my own data?"

    Yes! Most examples can be adapted to work with your datasets. Check the "Adapting This Example" section in each example for guidance.

??? question "Do I need to cite these examples in publications?"

    If you use example code substantially in your research, please cite our project. See citation information in each example.

??? question "Can I contribute my own examples?"

    Absolutely! We welcome community contributions. See our [Contributing Guide](../contributing/) for how to submit examples.

??? question "Are examples available for both Python and MATLAB?"

    Most examples include both Python and MATLAB implementations. Some advanced examples may be Python-only due to library dependencies.
