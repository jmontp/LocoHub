# Contributing (Deprecated)

This page has been superseded by the interactive guide at [Contribute Your Dataset](index.md).

- Follow the workflow diagrams and quick references in `index.md` for the current process.
- Tool-specific usage (validation, documentation generation, tuning ranges) is maintained there and kept in sync with the CLI helpers.

Legacy snippets remain available in git history if you need to reference the prior text.
