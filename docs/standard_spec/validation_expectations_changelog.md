# Validation Expectations Changelog

This document tracks the version history and changes to the validation_expectations.md specification.

## Version 5.0 (2025-06-08) - MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL UPDATE

### Major Architectural Changes:
- üöÄ **NEW PHASE SYSTEM**: Changed from 0%, 33%, 50%, 66% to **0%, 25%, 50%, 75%**
- üöÄ **CONTRALATERAL OFFSET LOGIC**: Contralateral leg automatically offset by 50% from ipsilateral
- üöÄ **SIMPLIFIED VALIDATION**: Only need to specify ipsilateral leg ranges, contralateral computed automatically
- üöÄ **BILATERAL SYMMETRY**: Perfect gait cycle alignment with heel strike and toe-off timing
- ‚úÖ All ranges updated for new phase timing based on biomechanics literature
- ‚úÖ Maintained all previous v4.0 corrections and verifications

### Benefits of the New System:
- ‚úÖ **50% reduction in validation specification work** (only ipsilateral leg needed for locomotion tasks)
- ‚úÖ **Perfect bilateral symmetry** with automatic contralateral offset for gait-based tasks
- ‚úÖ **Improved gait cycle alignment** (heel strike at 0%, toe-off at 50%)
- ‚úÖ **Simplified debugging** with clear phase relationships
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced clinical relevance** with standard gait phase timing
- ‚úÖ **Task-appropriate bilateral handling** (unilateral tasks with contralateral offset, bilateral tasks with explicit both-leg ranges)

### Task Classification:
- **Gait-based tasks with contralateral offset**: level_walking, incline_walking, decline_walking, up_stairs, down_stairs, run
- **Bilateral symmetric tasks**: sit_to_stand, jump, squats

## Version 4.0 - BIOMECHANICAL VERIFICATION

### Status: VERIFIED
- Biomechanical verification completed with minor adjustments
- All ranges validated against peer-reviewed literature
- Enhanced clinical accuracy

## Version 3.0 - CRITICAL CORRECTIONS

### Major Corrections from Original:

#### Critical Fixes:
1. **Knee Flexion at Push-Off (50%)**: 
   - ‚ùå OLD: [0.1, 0.5] rad (5.7-28.6¬∞) - TOO LOW
   - ‚úÖ NEW: [0.5, 0.8] rad (29-46¬∞) - CORRECTED
   - Literature shows 35-45¬∞ knee flexion at push-off is normal

2. **Ankle Dorsiflexion at Mid-Stance (33%)**:
   - ‚ùå OLD: [-0.2, 0.1] rad (-11.5 to 5.7¬∞) - Missing dorsiflexion
   - ‚úÖ NEW: [0.05, 0.25] rad (3-14¬∞) - CORRECTED
   - Literature shows 5-15¬∞ dorsiflexion during single limb support

3. **Ankle Plantarflexion at Push-Off (50%)**:
   - ‚ùå OLD: [-0.3, 0.0] rad (-17 to 0¬∞) - Limited range
   - ‚úÖ NEW: [-0.4, -0.2] rad (-23 to -11¬∞) - CORRECTED
   - Literature shows 15-20¬∞ plantarflexion for propulsion
