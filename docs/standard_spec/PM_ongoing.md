## Context Scratchpad

### OpenSim Conventions
- **Hip**: Flexion positive (thigh forward), extension negative
- **Knee**: Extension = 0°, flexion positive (0° → 140°) - KEY CONVENTION
- **Ankle**: Dorsiflexion positive (toes up), plantarflexion negative
- **Motion Capture Tolerance**: -10° minimum for knee due to measurement errors

### Key Files
- **sign_conventions.md**: Authoritative source for joint angle interpretation
- **validation_expectations_kinematic.md**: Phase-specific validation ranges  
- **validation_expectations_changelog.md**: Version history and changes
- **generate_phase_range_images.py**: Stick figure generation with corrected kinematics
