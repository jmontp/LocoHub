### Planar Forward Kinematic Chain (Reference)

The planar leg model used for visualization and torque modeling follows this
forward kinematic chain and reference frame:

<!-- Generated by internal/plot_generation/generate_forward_kinematics_reference.py -->

![Planar forward kinematic chain reference](../assets/forward_kinematics_reference.png)

Concise, complete description of what’s in the standardized data.

## Data Formats

| Format | File Pattern | Index | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|-------|---------|
| Phase‑Indexed | `*_phase.parquet` | 150 samples, 0–100% | Cross‑subject comparisons, averaging |
| Time‑Indexed | `*_time.parquet` | Seconds | Event detection, raw analysis |

Phase-aligned exports apply to cyclic gait data. Event-driven or non-cyclic activities should favor the time-indexed format, optionally providing per-repetition segments through the `step` column.

## Required Columns

| Column | Required | Meaning |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `subject` | Yes | Global unique ID (see Subject Naming) |
| `subject_metadata` | Optional | Demographics, key:value (e.g., `age:25,sex:M,height_m:1.75,weight_kg:70`) |
| `task` | Yes | Activity category (see Task Names) |
| `task_id` | Yes | Specific variant (see Task IDs) |
| `task_info` | Yes | Parameter string, key:value (see Task Metadata) |
| `step` | Yes | Cycle index within trial |
| `phase_ipsi` | Phase only | 0–100, phase of ipsilateral limb (heel‑strike to heel‑strike) |
| `time_s` | Time only | Seconds from trial start |

## Task Names, IDs, and Metadata

> The canonical list of task families lives in `internal/config_management/task_registry.py`.
> Update that module **and** this section whenever new tasks are introduced so that all
> tooling shares a single source of truth.

- Task names (`task`) capture the high-level motion family. Use neutral categories that apply across datasets, such as `level_walking`, `incline_walking`, `decline_walking`, `stair_ascent`, `stair_descent`, `run`, `walk_backward`, `sit_to_stand`, `stand_to_sit`, `step_up`, `step_down`, `jump`, `squats`, and the catch-all `functional_task` for non-cyclic or miscellaneous movements. Append population/pathology suffixes only when the entire recording targets that cohort. Use the convention `task_family_<pathology>` (e.g., `level_walking_stroke`, `run_pd`, `stair_descent_sci`). Keep suffix tokens lowercase snake_case (`stroke`, `pd`, `sci`, `tfa`, `tta`, etc.).
- Task IDs (`task_id`) describe the specific variant within the family, e.g., `level`, `incline_5deg`, `decline_10deg`, `stair_ascent`, `stair_descent`, `sit_to_stand_short`, `jump_vertical`. The exact vocabulary can differ by dataset, but it must remain stable inside a release.
- Task metadata (`task_info`) is a comma-separated key:value string carrying numeric parameters and variant tags. Values should prefer SI units and be machine-readable.

### Managing Task Families with the CLI

Use `python contributor_tools/manage_tasks.py` to add, delete, or list canonical task families without editing Python files by hand. Reach for the CLI when you introduce **new base families** that do not already exist in the registry. Examples:

- `python contributor_tools/manage_tasks.py list --category phase`
- `python contributor_tools/manage_tasks.py add lateral_walk --category phase --description "Side-step gait cycles" --example-id lateral --notes "Segment heel strikes the same way as level_walking."`
- `python contributor_tools/manage_tasks.py delete demo_task`

Pathology or cohort variants follow the `task_family_<pathology>` convention but do **not** require separate registry entries. Instead, create dedicated validation ranges for each suffix (e.g., `level_walking_stroke`) so tooling can read the cohort-specific tolerances. Validators never fall back to the able-bodied family values; use the interactive tuner to seed a new ranges file with the base family as an initializer before adjusting to the cohort norms.

Common task_info keys

- `speed_m_s:<float>`
- `treadmill:<true|false>`
- `incline_deg:<float>` (positive uphill, negative downhill)
- `step_height_m:<float>` (stairs)
- `step_width_m:<float>` (stairs)
- `surface:<string>` (e.g., overground, treadmill)
- `footwear:<string>` (e.g., barefoot, shoe)
- `assistance:<string>` (e.g., none, handrail)
- `transition_from:<task>` / `transition_to:<task>` (for mode switches)
- `turn_direction:<left|right|cw|ccw>` (for turning strides)
- `variant:<string>` (label specific instructions when no numeric parameter exists)

Exoskeleton/assistive device keys

- `exo_state:<powered|worn_unpowered|no_exo>` (exoskeleton condition)
- `exo_controller:<string>` (e.g., hilo, proportional, impedance)
- `exo_assistance_level:<float>` (percentage of bio moment, if applicable)
- `exo_joints:<hip|knee|hip_knee|ankle|...>` (which joints are actuated)

## Task Definitions

Task families fall into two groups. **Phase-friendly** tasks can be normalized to 150-sample strides when consistent events exist (and may also be exported in time if desired). **Time-indexed** tasks lack repeatable kinematic cycles or are best analyzed as continuous episodes. The tables below summarize each group; detailed notes follow.

### Phase-Friendly Families

When segmented, these tasks are normalized to 150 samples per stride with `phase_ipsi` running 0–100%. Phase output is preferred because it enables stride averaging and template validation; however, a time-indexed export is acceptable when segmentation is unavailable.

| Task | Typical behaviors | Example `task_id` values | Phase definition | Core metadata | Notes |
|------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| `level_walking` | Overground/treadmill at steady speed | `level`, `level_fast`, `level_slow` | 0% ipsilateral heel strike, 50% contralateral heel strike, 100% next ipsilateral heel strike | `speed_m_s`, `treadmill`, `surface` | Expect near-symmetric sagittal kinematics; large pelvis/trunk offsets flag coordinate issues. |
| `incline_walking` | Uphill ramps/treadmills | `incline_5deg`, `incline_10deg` | Same as level walking (HS-to-HS) | `incline_deg`, `treadmill`, `assistance` | Record grade and surface; uphill cycles show increased hip/knee flexion and trunk lean. |
| `decline_walking` | Downhill ramps/treadmills | `decline_5deg`, `decline_10deg` | Same as level walking with downhill HS events | `incline_deg` (negative), `treadmill` | Negative grades with delayed toe-off; expect larger eccentric knee moments. |
| `stair_ascent` | Ascending standard stairs | `stair_ascent`, numbered passes | 0% ipsilateral contact on current step, 100% ipsilateral contact on next step | `step_height_m`, `step_number`, `assistance` | Document geometry and handrail use; monitor hip/knee angles >90°. |
| `stair_descent` | Descending stairs | `stair_descent`, numbered passes | 0% upper-step contact, 100% lower-step contact for ipsilateral foot | `step_height_m`, `step_number`, `assistance` | Same metadata as ascent; eccentric control dominates mid-step. |
| `run` | Jogging/running with flight phases | `run_2_5_m_s`, `run_3_0_m_s` | 0% ipsilateral foot contact, 100% next ipsilateral contact including flight | `speed_m_s`, `treadmill`, `surface`, `footwear` | Two GRF peaks with flight intervals; watch pelvis rotation extremes. |
| `transition` | Gait-to-gait transitions | `walk_to_run`, `stair_to_walk`, `turn` | 0% key event of departing gait (e.g., heel strike), 100% first event of target gait | `transition_from`, `transition_to`, `gait_transition` | A single stride may cover two behaviors; store context keys and treat directions separately. |
| `sit_to_stand` / `stand_to_sit` | Chair or box transfers | `sit_to_stand`, `stand_to_sit` | 0% motion onset (velocity > 25 deg/s), 100% stable end state. GRF: sitting < 400N, standing > 600N. | `chair_height`, `armrests`, `variant` | See Sitting ↔ Standing archetype below. |
| `squat` | Loaded or bodyweight squats | `squat`, `squat_bodyweight`, `squat_25lbs` | 0% stable standing, ~50% lowest depth, 100% stable standing. | `weight_lbs`, `variant` | See Standing → Action → Standing archetype below. |
| `step_up` / `step_down` | Stair-box repetitions, curbs | `step_up`, `step_down` | Step-up: 0% initial foot contact on box, 100% full weight on box. Step-down mirrors with lower surface contact. | `height_m`, `lead_leg`, `step_number` | Treat like short stair runs; ensure cadence is repeatable before phase export. |
| `jump` | Bilateral vertical/lateral jumps | `jump_vertical`, `jump_lateral` | 0% stable standing, ~50% flight phase (GRF < 50N), 100% stable standing. | `jump_type`, `variant` | See Standing → Action → Standing archetype below. |
| `hop` | Unilateral (single-leg) repeated hops | `hop_single`, `hop_forward`, `hop_lateral` | 0% ipsilateral contact, 100% next ipsilateral contact. | `lead_leg`, `variant`, `direction` | Cyclic single-leg movement; segment contact-to-contact on same leg. |
| `lunge` | Forward or lateral lunges | `lunge_forward`, `lunge_lateral`, `lunge_walking` | 0% stable standing, ~50% lowest depth, 100% return to standing. | `direction`, `variant`, `load_kg` | See Standing → Action → Standing archetype below. |
| `weighted_walk`, `dynamic_walk`, `walk_backward` | Walking variants with perturbations | `level`, `variant:<string>` | Same as level walking (HS-to-HS) when heel strikes are present | `speed_m_s`, `treadmill`, `variant` | Prefer phase when heel strikes exist; otherwise document perturbation under `variant`. |

### Segmentation Archetypes

Phase-friendly tasks use one of three segmentation archetypes:

#### Heel Strike to Heel Strike (Gait)

Gait tasks are segmented using ipsilateral heel strikes as cycle boundaries:

```
Ipsi Heel Strike → Ipsi Stance → Ipsi Toe Off → Ipsi Swing → Ipsi Heel Strike
       0%              0-60%          ~60%         60-100%         100%
```

| Phase (%) | Event |
|-----------|-------|
| 0% | Ipsilateral heel strike (initial contact) |
| ~10% | Foot flat (loading response complete) |
| ~30% | Midstance (single-limb support) |
| ~50% | Contralateral heel strike |
| ~60% | Ipsilateral toe off (swing begins) |
| 100% | Next ipsilateral heel strike |

**Heel strike detection** uses GRF threshold crossings (typically 20-50N). When GRF is unavailable, use foot velocity minima or shank angle.

**Applies to**: `level_walking`, `incline_walking`, `decline_walking`, `stair_ascent`, `stair_descent`, `run`, `walk_backward`, `hop`

#### Standing → Action → Standing

Tasks that begin and end in stable standing, with a discrete action in between. Stable standing requires GRF > 600N AND joint velocity < 25 deg/s.

**Jump** (`jump`):
```
Stable Standing → Countermovement → Takeoff → Flight → Landing → Stable Standing
       0%            ~20-40%        ~40-50%   ~50-60%   ~60-80%       100%
```

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| FlightThreshold | 50 N | GRF below which subject is in flight |
| StandingThreshold | 600 N | GRF above which subject is standing |
| VelocityThreshold | 25 deg/s | Joint velocity below which motion is stable |

**Squat** (`squat`):
```
Stable Standing → Descent → Lowest Depth → Ascent → Stable Standing
       0%          ~25%         ~50%        ~75%        100%
```

Same detection parameters as jump, but no flight phase. Segment boundaries at stable standing states.

**Lunge** (`lunge`):
```
Stable Standing → Forward Step → Lowest Depth → Return Step → Stable Standing
       0%            ~25%           ~50%           ~75%           100%
```

Same detection parameters as squat. Forward lunges involve asymmetric loading; record `lead_leg` and `direction` metadata. Walking lunges may use stride-based segmentation instead.

#### Sitting ↔ Standing Transfers

Tasks that transition between seated and standing states using GRF-based state detection combined with joint velocity thresholds.

**Sit-to-stand** (`sit_to_stand`):
```
Stable Sitting → Motion Onset → Rising → Motion Offset → Stable Standing
                      0%                                      100%
```

**Stand-to-sit** (`stand_to_sit`):
```
Stable Standing → Motion Onset → Lowering → Motion Offset → Stable Sitting
                       0%                                        100%
```

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| SittingThreshold | 400 N | GRF below which subject is sitting |
| StandingThreshold | 600 N | GRF above which subject is standing |
| VelocityThreshold | 25 deg/s | Joint velocity threshold for motion onset/offset |

Motion onset is detected when joint velocity exceeds 25 deg/s; motion offset when it drops below.

### Time-Indexed (Non-Cyclic) Families

Export these tasks as time-indexed episodes. They lack consistent heel-strike structure, involve perturbations that break cyclic assumptions, or represent single-shot activities. If future datasets introduce segmentation for any of these behaviors, they can graduate to the phase-friendly group.

| Task | Typical behaviors | Example activities / `task_id` | Required metadata | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|-------|
| `agility_drill` | Multi-directional or cadence-driven drills without steady gait cycles | `side_shuffle`, `tire_run`, `dynamic_walk_high_knees`, `turn_and_step_left` | `variant`, `direction`, `cadence_hz`, `surface` | Capture cueing or treadmill settings; use when strides vary too much for phase export. |
| `cutting` | Athletic cuts with large heading changes | `cutting_left_fast`, `cutting_right_slow` | `direction`, `approach_speed_m_s`, `turn_angle_deg`, `surface` | Keep entire maneuver in time to preserve path-dependent kinetics. |
| `free_walk_episode` | Episodic or exploratory walking sequences | `meander`, `start_stop`, `obstacle_walk` | `surface`, `segment_start_s`, `segment_end_s`, `treadmill` | Use for trials with frequent pauses/obstacles where heel-strike segmentation is unreliable. |
| `load_handling` | Asymmetric lifts, carries, or object exchanges | `lift_weight_25lbs_l_c`, `ball_toss_center` | `load_kg`, `hand`, `pickup_height`, `dropoff_height`, `direction` | Document object mass and interaction side so bias/torque effects are traceable. |
| `perturbation` | External pushes/pulls or cooperative force tasks | `push_forward`, `tug_of_war`, `twister` | `direction`, `magnitude`, `support`, `implements` | Distinguish voluntary vs. reactive responses via metadata (e.g., `initiated_by:experimenter`). |
| `balance_pose` | Static or quasi-static holds | `poses_single_leg`, `poses_wide_stance`, `squat_hold` | `variant`, `duration_s`, `support` | Useful for calibration and balance assessments; ensure durations cover full hold. |
| `functional_task` | Miscellaneous non-cyclic behaviors not covered above | `variant:<string>` | `variant`, contextual keys as needed | Use sparingly; prefer one of the specific families when possible. |

When new datasets introduce additional behaviors, extend the table with the task family, expected metadata, and note whether improved segmentation would allow promotion to the phase-friendly bucket.

## Subject Naming

Format: `<DATASET_CODE>_<POPULATION_CODE><SUBJECT_NUMBER>` → e.g., `DS23_AB05`, `DS21_TFA03`. Keep subject numbers zero-padded to two digits where possible to aid sorting.

## Variables (What Columns Mean)

Naming pattern:
- Joint/segment variables: `<joint/segment>_<motion>_<measurement>_<side>_<unit>`
- GRF / CoP variables: `<signal_type>_<axis>_<side>_<unit>` (e.g., `grf_vertical_ipsi_BW`, `cop_anterior_contra_m`)

Key categories

- Ground reaction forces (GRF): `*_grf_*_BW` (body-weight-normalized)
- Segment orientations: `pelvis_*_angle_rad`, `trunk_*_angle_rad`, `thigh_*_angle_*_rad`, `shank_*_angle_*_rad`, `foot_*_angle_*_rad`

Sides

- `contra`: opposite limb (≈ 50% phase offset in level walking)

Units

- Angles in radians (`*_rad`)
- Moments are mass‑normalized (`*_Nm_kg`)

## Column Catalog

Canonical Python lists live in `src/locohub/feature_constants.py` (`PHASE_CANONICAL_COLUMNS`, `TIME_CANONICAL_COLUMNS`, and `CANONICAL_COLUMN_GROUPS`) to keep converters, validators, and docs aligned.

Complete list of standard column names used in the conversion scripts and examples. Columns are grouped by category; sides are `ipsi` and `contra` unless noted.

- Required schema: `subject`, `subject_metadata`, `task`, `task_id`, `task_info`, `step`, `phase_ipsi` (phase‑indexed) or `time_s` (time‑indexed)
- Optional schema: `phase_contra`, `dataset`, `collection_date`, `processing_date`

Kinematics — joint angles (radians)

- `hip_flexion_angle_{ipsi,contra}_rad`
- `hip_adduction_angle_{ipsi,contra}_rad`
- `knee_flexion_angle_{ipsi,contra}_rad`
- `ankle_dorsiflexion_angle_{ipsi,contra}_rad`

Kinetics — joint moments (Nm/kg)

These represent the **total net joint moment** from inverse dynamics. This is the sum of biological (human muscle) and assistance (exoskeleton/device) contributions. For datasets without assistive devices, total moment equals biological moment.

**Relationship**: `total moment = biological moment + assistance moment`

- `hip_flexion_moment_{ipsi,contra}_Nm_kg`
- `knee_flexion_moment_{ipsi,contra}_Nm_kg`
- `ankle_dorsiflexion_moment_{ipsi,contra}_Nm_kg`

Kinetics — assistance moments (Nm/kg)

External assistance torque provided by an exoskeleton or other assistive device. When `assistance_active` is true, these values represent torques actually applied to the joint. When false, these are simulated/estimated values (e.g., from a model running in the background but not commanding the actuators).

- `hip_flexion_assistance_moment_{ipsi,contra}_Nm_kg`
- `knee_flexion_assistance_moment_{ipsi,contra}_Nm_kg`
- `ankle_dorsiflexion_assistance_moment_{ipsi,contra}_Nm_kg`

Kinetics — biological moments (Nm/kg)

The moment produced by human muscles only. For exoskeleton data, this is the total moment minus the assistance contribution. Only present when assistance data is available to compute it.

- `hip_flexion_biological_moment_{ipsi,contra}_Nm_kg`
- `knee_flexion_biological_moment_{ipsi,contra}_Nm_kg`
- `ankle_dorsiflexion_biological_moment_{ipsi,contra}_Nm_kg`

## Coordinate & Sign Conventions

OpenSim right‑handed frames. Positive rotations follow right‑hand rule.

- Hip flexion (+): thigh forward; Knee flexion (+): heel toward buttocks
- Ankle dorsiflexion (+): toes up; Pelvis sagittal (+): anterior tilt

## Row & Phase/Time Semantics

- Each row = one sample within a step/cycle for a subject+task.
- Phase‑indexed: `phase_ipsi` runs 0→100% in each gait cycle of the ipsilateral limb (150 samples).
- Contra limb is approximately 50% offset in level walking.
- Time‑indexed: `time_s` increases monotonically; cycles delimited by gait events.

## GRF & CoP Variables

- GRF components: `grf_vertical_*`, `grf_anterior_*`, `grf_lateral_*` with suffix `_BW` or `_N`.
- Center of pressure: `cop_anterior_*_m`, `cop_lateral_*_m`, `cop_vertical_*_m` (meters), side‑specific where applicable.

### Expected GRF Patterns During Gait

Ground reaction forces follow characteristic patterns during the gait cycle. Understanding these patterns helps verify data quality and sign conventions.

**Vertical GRF** (`grf_vertical_*_BW`): Classic "M" shape during stance phase.

| Phase (%) | Pattern | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 0% | ~0.5 BW | Initial contact (heel strike) |
| 10-15% | ~1.1-1.2 BW | First peak (loading response) |
| 30% | ~0.8 BW | Valley (midstance, body vaulting over limb) |
| 45-50% | ~1.1-1.2 BW | Second peak (terminal stance) |
| 60% | ~0 BW | Toe off (swing begins) |

**Anterior GRF** (`grf_anterior_*_BW`): Biphasic braking-propulsion pattern.

| Phase (%) | Sign | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| 0-25% | Negative | Braking phase: force opposes forward motion (decelerates body) |
| 25-30% | ~0 | Crossover point |
| 30-60% | Positive | Propulsion phase: force accelerates body forward |

Sign convention: **Positive = propulsion** (forward force on body), **Negative = braking**.

**Lateral GRF** (`grf_lateral_*_BW`): "C" shape pattern directing force toward body midline.

| Phase (%) | Pattern | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 0-15% | Rising medial | Loading response |
| 15-30% | Peak medial | Single-limb support, lateral stabilization |
| 30-60% | Declining | Transition through push-off |

Sign convention: **Positive = medial** (toward body midline for ipsilateral limb).

### Expected COP Patterns During Gait

Center of pressure tracks the progression of force application through the foot during stance. Values are **stride-relative** (zeroed at heel strike position).

**Anterior COP** (`cop_anterior_*_m`): Heel-to-toe progression.

| Phase (%) | Pattern | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 0% | ~0 m | Heel strike (reference point) |
| 0-15% | Slight negative | Initial contact may be slightly posterior to reference |
| 15-60% | Progressive increase | COP advances from heel toward toe |
| 50-60% | +0.2 to +0.3 m | Forefoot/toe region at push-off |

Sign convention: **Positive = forward** (toe direction), values increase from heel (~0) to toe (~0.25m) through stance.

**Lateral COP** (`cop_lateral_*_m`): Medial-lateral progression.

| Phase (%) | Pattern | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 0-15% | Near zero | Heel contact, lateral heel position |
| 15-40% | Slight medial shift | Weight transfer toward midline |
| 40-60% | Return toward neutral | Push-off through medial forefoot |

Sign convention: **Positive = medial** (toward body midline for ipsilateral limb).

**Vertical COP** (`cop_vertical_*_m`): Approximately constant.

- Represents ground level beneath the foot (~0.02-0.05m depending on instrumentation)
- Should remain relatively constant throughout stance since it reflects ankle-to-ground distance
- Large variations may indicate force plate artifacts or coordinate system issues

### COP Coordinate Reference

COP values in the standardized format are **stride-relative**, meaning:

1. At heel strike (phase 0%), COP anterior is zeroed to the heel strike position
2. As the gait cycle progresses, COP anterior increases as force moves toward the toe
3. This allows direct comparison across subjects and trials regardless of absolute position

If COP values are in global coordinates (e.g., treadmill belt position), they must be transformed to stride-relative values during conversion.

## Naming Rules

- Lowercase snake_case; tokens separated by single underscores.
- Use exact unit suffix tokens: `rad`, `Nm_kg`, `BW`, `m`, `s`.
- Segment/global (no side): e.g., `pelvis_*_angle_rad`, `trunk_*_angle_rad`.
- Side tokens: `ipsi` or `contra` only.

## Optional Columns & Flags

- `phase_contra` (percent): contra limb phase, if present.
- `cycle_id`: optional alias of `step`.
- `dataset`: dataset identifier; `collection_date`, `processing_date` (ISO strings) if available.
- Quality flags (boolean): e.g., `is_reconstructed_<side>` for interpolated values.

Assistance/exoskeleton flags:

- `assistance_active` (boolean): True if assistance torques were actually applied to the joints during data collection. False if assistance values are simulated/estimated but not physically applied (e.g., unpowered exo trials with a model running in the background).

Canonical phase column is `phase_ipsi`.
