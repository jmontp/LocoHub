## Lab Description
The Locomotor Control Systems Laboratory is a highly interdisciplinary environment dedicated to scientific innovation, 
clinical translation, and individual career development. The lab develops high-performance control systems for robotic 
prostheses and orthoses to enable mobility and improve quality of life for persons with disabilities. The research 
approaches this needs-driven work from the perspective of dynamical systems and control theory, investigating and 
translating concepts from legged robotics into transformative solutions for physical rehabilitation.

Dr. Gregg's research interests include actuator design and control, nonlinear control theory, and biomechanics of 
human locomotion. He is most known for his works on bipedal locomotion control and wearable robotics, with research 
focusing on integrating human biomechanics insights into robot control algorithms to improve natural movement efficiency.

## Usage

```python
from user_libs.python.locomotion_data import LocomotionData

# Load the dataset
