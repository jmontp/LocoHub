## Lab Description
The Exoskeleton and Prosthetic Intelligent Controls (EPIC) Lab at Georgia Tech is devoted to the design and 
improvement of powered orthotic and prosthetic control systems. The lab combines machine learning, robotics, 
human biomechanics, and control systems to design wearable robots that improve community mobility for 
individuals with walking disability.

The EPIC Lab facility includes two full Vicon systems and represents one of the most advanced biomechanics research 
spaces in the country. Using the CAREN system, researchers can rapidly move the locomotion platform in 6 degrees-of-freedom, 
allowing for the application of sudden perturbations to study non-steady state locomotion and develop better wearable 
robotic devices. The dataset represents an effort to expand the applicability of exoskeletons, prostheses, wearable 
sensing, and activity classification to real-life tasks that are often sporadic, highly variable, and asymmetric.

## Usage

```python
from user_libs.python.locomotion_data import LocomotionData

# Load the dataset
data = LocomotionData('converted_datasets/gtech_2023_phase.parquet')

# Get data for analysis
cycles_3d, features = data.get_cycles('SUB01', 'level_walking')
```
