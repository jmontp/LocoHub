# Documentation Accuracy Audit Report

**Comprehensive Analysis of Current Documentation Truth vs. Code Reality**

**Audit Date**: 2025-06-19
**Auditor**: Doc-Agent-03 (Truth-First Documentation Specialist)
**Scope**: Complete repository documentation accuracy assessment
**Methodology**: Direct testing of documented claims against actual codebase

## Executive Summary

**Critical Finding**: Significant gaps found between documented capabilities and actual implementation. Current documentation makes claims that cannot be verified through testing, potentially misleading users about system capabilities.

**Overall Accuracy Rating**: 🚧 **Needs Major Revision** (estimated 40-60% accuracy)

**Immediate Action Required**: Implement truth-first documentation framework before any public release.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Import Path Failures ❌ CRITICAL

**Documented Claim** (README.md lines 28-32):
```python
sys.path.append('source/lib/python')
from locomotion_analysis import LocomotionData
data = LocomotionData.from_parquet('dataset.parquet')
```

**Testing Result**: ❌ **FAILS**
- Path `source/lib/python` does not exist
- Actual library location: `lib/core/locomotion_analysis.py`
- Correct import requires: `sys.path.append('lib')` and `from core.locomotion_analysis import LocomotionData`

**Impact**: High - Users following README examples will encounter immediate import failures

**Status**: Unverified claim in primary documentation

### 2. CLI Tool Execution Failures ❌ CRITICAL

**Documented Claim** (README.md line 53):
```bash
python source/validation/dataset_validator_phase.py --dataset your_dataset_phase.parquet
```

**Testing Result**: ❌ **FAILS**
```
ImportError: Could not import required library modules: attempted relative import with no known parent package
```

**Root Cause**: 
- Tool references wrong path: `source/validation/` (doesn't exist)
- Actual tool location: `lib/validation/dataset_validator_phase.py`
- Import structure issues prevent standalone execution

**Impact**: High - Primary validation workflow documented in README is non-functional

### 3. GitHub Actions Path Mismatches ❌ CRITICAL

**Documented Workflow** (.github/workflows/regenerate-validation-plots.yml lines 44, 54):
```bash
python3 source/validation/generate_validation_plots.py
```

**Testing Result**: ❌ **FAILS**
- Path `source/validation/generate_validation_plots.py` does not exist  
- Actual location: `lib/validation/generate_validation_plots.py`
- GitHub Actions workflow will fail when triggered

**Impact**: High - Automated documentation regeneration is broken

### 4. Tutorial File Path Issues ⚠️ MEDIUM

**Documented Claim** (Tutorial test file):
```python
df_locomotion = pd.read_csv('../docs/user_guide/docs/tutorials/test_files/locomotion_data.csv')
```

**Testing Result**: ❌ **FAILS**
```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '../docs/user_guide/docs/tutorials/test_files/locomotion_data.csv'
```

**Root Cause**: Relative path assumptions don't work from test execution location

**Impact**: Medium - Tutorial examples fail when run from different directories

### 5. MATLAB Path Claims 🚧 PARTIAL

**Documented Claim** (README.md lines 36-40):
```matlab
addpath('source/lib/matlab')
data = LocomotionData('dataset.parquet');
```

**Testing Result**: 🚧 **PARTIALLY ACCURATE**
- Path `source/lib/matlab` exists ✅
- `LocomotionData.m` file exists ✅
- Cannot verify functionality without MATLAB environment ⚠️

**Status**: Path claims accurate but functionality unverified

### 6. Feature Status Misrepresentation ❌ CRITICAL

**Documented Claims** (Various locations):
- "Easy-to-use validation tools" (tools have import issues)
- "Comprehensive data loading and analysis capabilities" (basic functionality only)
- References to working CLI tools (most fail to execute)

**Testing Result**: ❌ **OVERSTATED CAPABILITIES**

**Impact**: High - Users may choose this tool based on inflated capability claims

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues Identified:

1. **No Verification Process**: Documentation written without testing against actual code
2. **Path Management Problems**: Files moved without updating documentation
3. **Import Structure Issues**: Library not properly packaged for documented usage patterns
4. **Assumption-Based Writing**: Documentation assumes certain structures exist
5. **No Documentation Testing**: No CI/CD validation of documented examples

### Contributing Factors:

1. **Development vs. Documentation Misalignment**: Code evolves but docs don't track changes
2. **No Truth-First Culture**: Emphasis on describing intent rather than reality
3. **Missing QA Process**: No systematic verification before publication
4. **Tool Integration Issues**: Documentation and code development happen in isolation

## Recommendations
