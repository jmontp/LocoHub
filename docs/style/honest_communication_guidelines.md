# Honest Communication Guidelines

**Framework for Transparent Documentation and User Communication**

Created: 2025-06-19 with user permission
Purpose: Establish clear guidelines for honest communication about system capabilities and limitations

Intent: Build user trust through transparent, accurate communication that sets appropriate expectations and helps users make informed decisions.

## Core Communication Principles

### 1. Reality-First Communication
**Always lead with what actually exists, not what's planned or intended.**

**Communication Hierarchy**:
1. **Current Reality**: What works right now
2. **Known Limitations**: What doesn't work or has issues
3. **Workarounds**: How to achieve goals despite limitations
4. **Future Plans**: What's planned (with realistic timelines)

**Example Application**:
```markdown
❌ BAD: "Comprehensive data validation and ML benchmarking tools"
✅ GOOD: 
"**Current Capabilities:**
- ✅ Phase-indexed dataset validation (tested, working)
- 🚧 Time-indexed validation (partial implementation)
- 📋 ML benchmarking (planned for Q3 2025)

**Known Issues:**
- Validation tools require manual path setup
- Import errors on fresh installations (workaround available)"
```

### 2. Status-Transparent Language
**Use clear, consistent indicators for feature status.**

**Standard Status Language**:
- **✅ Available**: Feature is complete, tested, and working reliably
- **🚧 Partial**: Core functionality works but has documented limitations
- **🔄 In Development**: Feature is being actively implemented (with timeline)
- **📋 Planned**: Feature is designed but not yet started (with target date)
- **⚠️ Has Issues**: Feature exists but has known problems (with workarounds)
- **❌ Not Available**: Feature is not implemented and no timeline exists
- **🚫 Deprecated**: Feature is being removed (with migration timeline)

**Language Templates**:
```markdown
✅ GOOD Examples:
"**✅ Available**: Load phase-indexed datasets with `LocomotionData.from_parquet()`"
"**🚧 Partial**: MATLAB integration supports data loading but plotting has import issues"
"**📋 Planned**: Automated ML benchmark generation (target: Q3 2025)"
"**⚠️ Has Issues**: Validation CLI requires `sys.path.append('lib')` before import"

❌ BAD Examples:
"Easy-to-use validation tools" (vague, unverifiable)
"Comprehensive MATLAB support" (overstates actual capability)
"Coming soon" (no specific timeline)
```

### 3. Limitation-Aware Documentation
**Proactively communicate limitations rather than hiding them.**

**Limitation Communication Framework**:
1. **Acknowledge the limitation clearly**
2. **Explain the impact on users**  
3. **Provide working workarounds**
4. **Include timeline for resolution if planned**

**Template for Limitation Communication**:
```markdown
## Known Limitations

### [Limitation Name]
**Impact**: [Who is affected and how]
**Technical cause**: [Brief explanation of why limitation exists]

**Workaround** (tested working):
```bash
# Specific steps to work around the limitation
[step_1]
[step_2]
```

**Resolution status**: [Planned/In Progress/No timeline]
**Target timeline**: [Specific date if known, "No timeline" if unknown]
```

**Real Example**:
```markdown
### Import Path Issues
**Impact**: Python tutorials fail on fresh installations with import errors
**Technical cause**: Library modules not in standard Python path

**Workaround** (tested working):
```python
# Add this before importing locomotion modules
import sys
sys.path.append('lib')
from core.locomotion_analysis import LocomotionData
```

**Resolution status**: Planned - restructuring to proper Python package
**Target timeline**: Q2 2025
```

## User Expectation Management

### 1. Pre-Commitment Clarity
**Set accurate expectations before users invest time.**

**Expectation Setting Template**:
```markdown
## What You Can Accomplish

**Immediately available**:
- [Specific capability 1] - works reliably
- [Specific capability 2] - tested and documented
- [Specific capability 3] - with minor setup requirements

**Requires workarounds**:
- [Capability with limitation] - achievable via [workaround method]
- [Partial feature] - basic functionality only, [specific limitations]

**Not currently possible**:
- [Unavailable feature] - planned for [timeline]
- [Missing capability] - no current implementation

**Time investment**: [X] minutes for basic setup, [Y] minutes for first success
**Technical level**: [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced] - [specific skills needed]
```

### 2. Success Probability Communication
**Help users understand their likelihood of success.**

**Success Framework**:
```markdown
## Success Likelihood

**High probability of success** (>90% of users):
- You have [specific requirements]
- You're working with [supported data types]
- You need [basic functionality]

**Medium probability** (70-90% success):
- You have [alternative requirements] 
- You're willing to use workarounds
- You have [intermediate technical skills]

**Lower probability** (<70% success):
- You need [unsupported features]
- You're working with [edge case scenarios]
- You require [unavailable functionality]

**Before starting**: Verify your scenario matches a high-probability case
```

### 3. Failure Mode Transparency
**Communicate common failure points before they occur.**

**Common Failure Communication**:
```markdown
## Common Challenges

**Most users encounter these issues**:

### Issue 1: [Common Problem]
**Frequency**: [X]% of users encounter this
**Symptom**: [What user experiences]
**Typical cause**: [Why it happens]
**Solution**: [Tested fix]
**Prevention**: [How to avoid]

### Issue 2: [Another Common Problem]
**When it occurs**: [Specific conditions]
**Workaround**: [Alternative approach]
**Resolution timeline**: [When fix is expected]
```

## Progress Communication

### 1. Development Status Updates
**Provide regular, accurate updates on development progress.**

**Status Update Template**:
```markdown
## Development Status Update - [Date]

### Completed This Period
- ✅ [Specific achievement 1] - [brief description]
- ✅ [Specific achievement 2] - [impact on users]
- ✅ [Bug fix] - [what was broken, now works]

### In Progress
- 🔄 [Feature in development] - [X]% complete, targeting [date]
- 🔄 [Investigation] - [current findings]

### Planned Next
- 📋 [Next milestone] - starting [date], targeting [completion]
- 📋 [Planned fix] - depends on [dependency]

### Delays/Changes
- ⏱️ [Delayed item] - new target [date], reason: [explanation]
- 🔄 [Changed priority] - now scheduled for [new timeline]

### User Impact
**What this means for current users**:
- [Capability that improved]
- [Issue that was resolved] 
- [New limitation to be aware of]
```

### 2. Roadmap Communication
**Communicate future plans with appropriate uncertainty indicators.**

**Roadmap Language**:
```markdown
## Roadmap Communication Guidelines

**Confidence levels for timeline communication**:
- **Target dates** (80-90% confidence): "Targeting Q2 2025"
- **Rough timelines** (60-80% confidence): "Planned for mid-2025"  
- **Aspirational goals** (40-60% confidence): "Goal to complete by end of 2025"
- **Research phase** (<40% confidence): "Investigating feasibility, timeline TBD"

**Always include confidence indicators**:
✅ GOOD: "Targeting Q2 2025 for ML benchmarking (high confidence - design complete)"
✅ GOOD: "Goal to add advanced analytics by end 2025 (research phase - timeline uncertain)"
❌ BAD: "ML benchmarking coming in Q2" (implies certainty without confidence level)
```

## Issue Response Communication

### 1. Problem Acknowledgment
**Respond to issues with honesty and clear next steps.**

**Issue Response Template**:
```markdown
## Issue: [Problem Description]

### Acknowledgment
**Status**: Confirmed/Under investigation/Cannot reproduce
**Impact**: [Who is affected, severity level]
**First reported**: [Date]
**Reports received**: [Number of users affected]

### Investigation Status
**Current understanding**: [What we know about the cause]
**Reproduction**: [Can we reproduce it? Under what conditions?]
**Root cause**: [If known] / Under investigation

### Immediate Actions
**Workarounds available**:
- [Workaround 1] - tested with [X] users
- [Workaround 2] - works for [specific scenarios]

**Not currently possible**: [What cannot be worked around]

### Resolution Plan
**Next steps**:
1. [Specific action 1] - by [date]
2. [Specific action 2] - by [date]  
3. [Resolution delivery] - targeting [date]

**Confidence in timeline**: [High/Medium/Low] - [reasoning]
**Dependencies**: [What needs to happen first]

### Communication Plan
**Updates will be provided**:
- [Frequency] for active investigation
- [Milestone updates] for major progress
- [Final resolution] announcement

**How to track progress**: [Link to issue tracker/status page]
```

### 2. Negative News Communication
**Deliver bad news clearly and constructively.**

**Negative News Framework**:
```markdown
## Delivering Difficult News

### Structure for negative communications:
1. **Clear statement of the issue**
2. **Honest assessment of impact**  
3. **Available alternatives/workarounds**
4. **Timeline for resolution (if any)**
5. **How users can adapt**

### Example - Feature Delay:
"**Update on ML Benchmarking Feature**

**Issue**: The ML benchmarking feature originally planned for Q2 2025 will be delayed.

**New timeline**: Q4 2025 (6-month delay)

**Reason**: Discovery of data compatibility issues requiring architecture changes.

**Impact on users**: 
- Current users: No change to existing functionality
- Planned adopters: Manual benchmarking workflows remain necessary

**Alternatives**: 
- Use manual benchmarking scripts in `scripts/manual_benchmarks/`
- Third-party tools: [specific recommendations]

**What we're doing**: Redesigning the feature for better long-term compatibility

**Communication**: Monthly updates on progress, email notifications for major milestones"
```

## Quality Assurance for Communication

### 1. Communication Verification
**Every communication must be fact-checked against reality.**

**Verification Checklist**:
- [ ] **All status claims verified** against actual implementation
- [ ] **Timeline estimates based** on actual development data
- [ ] **Workarounds tested** and confirmed working  
- [ ] **Impact assessments accurate** based on user research
- [ ] **Technical explanations correct** and accessible
- [ ] **Next steps realistic** and resourced appropriately

### 2. User Testing of Communication
**Test communication clarity with actual users.**

**Communication Testing Process**:
1. **Draft communication** following guidelines
2. **Internal review** for accuracy and tone
3. **User testing** with representative users
4. **Revision** based on user feedback
5. **Publication** with feedback incorporated

**Testing Questions**:
- Do users understand what they can/cannot do?
- Are expectations appropriately set?
- Do users know how to proceed?
- Is the timeline communication clear?
- Are workarounds sufficiently detailed?

### 3. Consistency Monitoring
**Ensure communication consistency across all channels.**

**Consistency Framework**:
- **Status terminology**: Use standard status indicators consistently
- **Timeline language**: Apply confidence levels uniformly  
- **Limitation acknowledgment**: Same limitations mentioned everywhere
- **Workaround descriptions**: Identical solutions across all documentation

**Regular Audits**:
- **Monthly**: Check for inconsistent status claims
- **Quarterly**: Verify timeline communications remain accurate
- **Release cycle**: Update all communication for new realities

## Community Trust Building

### 1. Transparency Practices
**Build trust through consistent honest communication.**

**Trust Building Actions**:
- **Admit mistakes quickly** and explain what went wrong
- **Update outdated claims** as soon as discovered
- **Share uncertainty** rather than false confidence
- **Credit community contributions** and feedback
- **Respond to criticism constructively**

### 2. Expectation Calibration
**Help community develop realistic expectations.**

**Calibration Strategies**:
- **Share development realities** (what takes longer than expected)
- **Explain complexity** of seemingly simple features  
- **Discuss trade-offs** in design decisions
- **Communicate resource constraints** honestly
- **Celebrate realistic achievements** rather than overpromising

### 3. Feedback Integration
**Show that community input influences direction.**

**Feedback Integration Communication**:
```markdown
## Community Feedback Integration

**This month's community input**:
- [User suggestion 1] - implemented in [version]
- [Bug report] - fixed with workaround published
- [Feature request] - added to Q3 roadmap
- [Documentation feedback] - guides updated

**How feedback is prioritized**:
1. Critical bugs affecting many users
2. Simple improvements with high impact
3. Feature requests aligned with roadmap
4. Documentation gaps identified by users

**Feedback we cannot act on** (and why):
- [Request] - requires [significant resource/architectural change]
- [Suggestion] - conflicts with [design principle/user need]
```

This framework ensures that all communication builds trust through honesty, manages expectations appropriately, and helps users make informed decisions about using the system.
