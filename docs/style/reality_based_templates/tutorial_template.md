```

**Expected output**:
```
[actual output from testing]
```

## Code Block Requirements

**Every code block must include:**
- **Verification date**: When it was last tested
- **Environment info**: Where it was tested
- **Success criteria**: What constitutes "working"
- **Error handling**: Expected failure modes

```markdown
**Tested Code Example** (verified YYYY-MM-DD on [environment]):
```python
# This exact code was executed and verified working
import pandas as pd

# Load test data
data = pd.read_csv('sample_data.csv')
print(f"Loaded {len(data)} rows successfully")
```

**Expected output**:
```
Loaded 150 rows successfully
```

**Testing verification**:
```bash
# Commands used to verify this example
ls -la sample_data.csv  # File must exist
python3 -c "import pandas; print('pandas working')"
```
```

## Prerequisites Section Template

```markdown
## Prerequisites

**Required (tested and verified)**:
- [ ] Python 3.8+ installed (`python3 --version`)
- [ ] Pandas library (`pip list | grep pandas`)
- [ ] Sample data files in working directory (`ls sample_data.csv`)

**Verification script**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Prerequisite verification script - run this first
echo "Checking prerequisites..."

# Check Python version
python3 --version || { echo "‚ùå Python 3 not found"; exit 1; }

# Check required packages
python3 -c "import pandas" || { echo "‚ùå Pandas not installed"; exit 1; }

# Check data files
ls sample_data.csv >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo "‚ùå Sample data missing"; exit 1; }

echo "‚úÖ All prerequisites verified"
```

**If verification fails**:
- **Python not found**: [Link to Python installation guide]
- **Pandas not installed**: Run `pip install pandas`
- **Data files missing**: [Link to data download section]
```

## Troubleshooting Section Template

```markdown
## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Import Errors
**Typical error**:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xyz'
```

**Working solution**:
```python
# Add this at the beginning of your script
import sys
sys.path.append('path/to/modules')  # Adjust path as needed
import xyz
```

**Why this is needed**: [Explanation of the underlying issue]
