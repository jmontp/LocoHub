## Implementation Checklist

### For Each Section

**Content Preparation:**
- [ ] Identify primary, secondary, and tertiary audiences
- [ ] Write specific, actionable learning outcomes (not generic topics)
- [ ] Create tailored value propositions for each user type
- [ ] Estimate realistic reading time based on content length
- [ ] Map navigation flow (previous → current → next)

**Template Application:**
- [ ] Apply appropriate section icon and title
- [ ] Write clear, one-sentence purpose statement
- [ ] Create user-specific value proposition tabs
- [ ] List subsections with descriptive summaries
- [ ] Add quick reference with key facts and common pitfalls
- [ ] Include relevant cross-references with context
- [ ] Create progress tracking checklist

**Quality Assurance:**
- [ ] Test all internal and external links
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness of tabbed content
- [ ] Ensure consistent visual formatting
- [ ] Validate MkDocs admonition rendering
- [ ] Check navigation flow accuracy
- [ ] Confirm time estimates are realistic

### Content Writing Standards

**Purpose Statements:**
- Start with action verb (Understand, Discover, Define, etc.)
- Include specific outcome or benefit
- Mention target audience
- Keep to one sentence maximum

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Use active, specific language
- Focus on what users will be able to do
- Avoid generic phrases like "learn about"
- Include measurable or observable outcomes

**Value Propositions:**
- Address specific user goals and pain points
- Explain concrete benefits, not just features
- Use user-focused language ("you will be able to...")
- Differentiate value for each user type

**Cross-References:**
- Always explain the relationship between sections
- Provide context for why someone would follow the link
- Use consistent link formatting and descriptions
- Prioritize most relevant connections

## Template Maintenance
