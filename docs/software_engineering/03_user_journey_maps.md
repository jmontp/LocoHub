**Optimal Strategy**: Layer prevention and recovery systems, with prevention as primary defense and recovery as essential backup for complex, real-world usage patterns.

The failure flows reveal that resilient systems require both robust error prevention and comprehensive recovery mechanisms tailored to each user type's capabilities and needs. Understanding these failure patterns enables the design of more robust, user-friendly systems that gracefully handle the inevitable challenges of real-world usage.
