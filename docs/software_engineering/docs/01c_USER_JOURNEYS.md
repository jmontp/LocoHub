!!! abstract "**TL;DR - User Journey Overview**"
    **Current Focus:** Dataset contributor workflows (Phase 1)
    
    - **Journey 1:** Technical dataset conversion by programmer
    - **Journey 2:** Validation specification updates by domain expert  
    - **Journey 3:** Collaborative dataset contribution (programmer + validator)
    - **Future:** Simplified consumer experience (Phase 2)
    
    **Key Insight:** Quality-first approach requires sophisticated contributor tools before simple consumer interfaces.
