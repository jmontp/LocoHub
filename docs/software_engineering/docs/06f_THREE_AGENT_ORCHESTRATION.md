!!! abstract ":zap: TL;DR - Independent Development with Orchestrated Integration"
    - **True Independence:** Test and Code agents work without cross-contamination
    - **Systematic Integration:** Integration Agent provides structured debugging and coordination
    - **Conflict Resolution:** Formal procedures for resolving interface and logic mismatches
    - **Quality Assurance:** Multi-stream validation ensures comprehensive system quality

## Orchestration Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Agent Independence**: Test and Code agents operate without knowledge of each other's implementations
- **Interface-Driven Development**: All communication occurs through well-defined contracts and specifications
- **Systematic Integration**: Integration Agent coordinates testing and debugging without bias toward either stream
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement through structured feedback loops
- **Quality Convergence**: Independent development streams converge on high-quality integrated solutions

### Orchestration Benefits
- **Reduced Bias**: Tests cannot be written to pass specific implementations
- **Improved Quality**: Code cannot be optimized for specific test cases
- **True Interface Validation**: Integration testing validates actual contract compliance
- **Parallel Development**: Independent streams enable faster development cycles
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multiple perspectives ensure thorough system validation

## Agent Role Definitions and Responsibilities

### Test Agent Responsibilities

#### Primary Functions

            test_suite, requirements_package
        )
        
        return coverage_analysis.is_complete()
```

#### Code Agent Development Process
```python
# Code Agent development workflow
class CodeAgentWorkflow:
    """Manages Code Agent development process"""
    
    def implement_components(self, interface_contracts):
        """Implement all components per interface contracts"""
        implementations = {}
        
        for contract in interface_contracts:
            # Implement component per interface specification
            implementation = self._implement_component_contract(contract)
            
            # Optimize for performance requirements
            optimized_implementation = self._optimize_performance(
                implementation, contract.performance_requirements
            )
            
            implementations[contract.component_name] = optimized_implementation
        
        return implementations

        for contract in interface_contracts:
            implementation = implementations[contract.component_name]
            compliance = self._validate_interface_compliance(implementation, contract)
            compliance_results[contract.component_name] = compliance
        
        return compliance_results
```

#### Integration Agent Coordination Process
```python
# Integration Agent coordination workflow
class IntegrationAgentWorkflow:
    """Manages Integration Agent coordination process"""
    
    def execute_integration_cycle(self, test_suite, implementations):
        """Execute complete integration testing cycle"""
        # Execute all tests against implementations
        test_results = self._execute_tests(test_suite, implementations)
        
        # Analyze failures and categorize for resolution
        failure_analysis = self._analyze_failures(test_results)
        
        # Validate performance benchmarks
        performance_validation = self._validate_performance(test_results)

    def resolve_interface_mismatch(self, failure_details):
        """Resolve interface mismatch between test and implementation"""
        # Analyze interface contract for clarity
        contract_analysis = self._analyze_interface_contract(failure_details.contract)
        
        if contract_analysis.is_clear():
            # Contract is clear, implementation needs adjustment
            return ResolutionTask(
                agent="Code Agent",
                action="Update implementation to match interface contract",
                details=failure_details

            )
    
    def resolve_behavioral_failure(self, failure_details):
        """Resolve behavioral logic mismatch"""
        # Analyze test expectations against requirements
        requirements_analysis = self._analyze_requirements_compliance(
            failure_details.test_expectations,
            failure_details.requirements
        )
        
        if requirements_analysis.test_correct():
            # Test correctly represents requirements, implementation needs adjustment
            return ResolutionTask(
                agent="Code Agent",
                action="Update implementation logic to meet behavioral requirements",
                details=failure_details
            )
        else:
            # Test incorrectly represents requirements, test needs adjustment
            return ResolutionTask(
