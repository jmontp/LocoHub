## Three-Agent Development Testing Framework

### Agent-Based Development Architecture

The three-agent approach enables independent development streams with systematic integration:

- **Test Agent**: Creates comprehensive test suites without knowledge of implementation
- **Code Agent**: Develops implementations without access to specific test details
- **Integration Agent**: Orchestrates testing and debugging between independent streams

### Test-First Development Without Code Knowledge

#### Test Agent Framework
**Purpose**: Enable test creation based purely on requirements and behavioral specifications

**Test Creation Inputs (Code-Blind)**:
- User stories with detailed acceptance criteria
- Interface behavioral specifications with expected inputs/outputs
- Domain knowledge requirements (biomechanical validation rules)
- Success metrics and comprehensive error condition definitions
- Performance requirements and scalability expectations

**Test Creation Outputs**:
- Unit test stubs with expected behaviors and mock dependencies
- Integration test scenarios covering complete user workflows
- User acceptance test scripts with domain expert validation criteria
- Performance benchmark tests with resource usage expectations
- Error handling tests covering all failure modes

**Test Specification Templates**:
```markdown
### Behavioral Requirement → Test Case Mapping
- **Requirement**: PhaseValidator must reject datasets with != 150 points per cycle
- **Test Case**: Submit datasets with 149, 151 points; expect ValidationError
- **Success Criteria**: Clear error message specifying required 150 points

### User Story → Acceptance Test Conversion
- **User Story**: As a curator, I need validation reports showing data quality
- **Acceptance Test**: Generate report from known dataset; verify accuracy metrics
- **Success Criteria**: Report matches manually calculated quality statistics

### Interface Contract → Component Test Generation
- **Interface**: validate_phase_data(dataframe) → ValidationResult
- **Component Test**: Mock dataframe inputs; verify ValidationResult structure
- **Success Criteria**: Consistent output format across all valid inputs
```

### Implementation-First Development Without Test Knowledge

#### Code Agent Framework
**Purpose**: Enable implementation based purely on interface contracts and technical specifications

**Code Development Inputs (Test-Blind)**:
- Interface contracts with precise behavioral requirements
- Technical specifications including algorithms and data structures
- Performance requirements with specific benchmarks
- Error handling contracts with required exception types
- Data structure definitions with validation rules

**Code Development Guidelines**:
- **Interface-driven development**: Implement exact method signatures with specified behaviors
- **Clean architecture principles**: Separate concerns for maximum testability
- **Error handling contract compliance**: Raise specified exceptions for defined conditions
- **Performance optimization**: Meet specified benchmarks within resource constraints
- **Documentation requirements**: Document intent and assumptions for integration clarity

**Implementation Patterns**:
```python
# Interface Contract Implementation
class PhaseValidator:
    """Validates phase-indexed biomechanical datasets"""
    
    def validate_phase_data(self, dataframe: pd.DataFrame) -> ValidationResult:
        """
        Contract: Validate 150-point phase structure and biomechanical ranges
        
        Args:
            dataframe: Phase-indexed data with required columns
            
        Returns:
            ValidationResult with pass/fail status and detailed metrics
            
        Raises:
            ValidationError: For structural violations (point count, missing columns)
            ValueError: For invalid input types or formats
        """
        # Implementation follows contract specifications
        pass
```

### Test Execution and Integration Debugging

#### Integration Agent Framework
**Purpose**: Execute externally created tests against externally created code

**Integration Testing Procedures**:
- **Execute Test Suites**: Run Test Agent tests against Code Agent implementations
- **Systematic Failure Analysis**: Categorize failures (interface mismatch, logic error, performance)
- **Performance Validation**: Verify implementations meet benchmark requirements
- **Integration Issue Resolution**: Coordinate fixes with appropriate agent streams

**Debugging Workflows**:
```markdown
### Failure Classification System
1. **Interface Mismatch**: Method signature or return type incompatibility
2. **Logic Error**: Correct interface but incorrect behavioral implementation
3. **Performance Issue**: Implementation fails to meet specified benchmarks
4. **Error Handling**: Missing or incorrect exception handling

### Resolution Protocols
- **Interface Issues**: Return to Code Agent with contract clarification
- **Logic Errors**: Provide failing test context without revealing test implementation
- **Performance Problems**: Share benchmark requirements and profiling data
- **Error Handling**: Specify required exception types and trigger conditions
```

### Agent Independence Protocols

#### Test Agent Isolation
**Requirements-Only Test Creation**:
- Create tests based solely on user stories and acceptance criteria
- Use mock frameworks for component dependencies
- Focus on behavioral validation without implementation assumptions
- Validate expected outcomes without knowledge of internal logic

**Mock Framework Integration**:
```python
# Test Agent creates behavior-focused tests
def test_phase_validator_rejects_incorrect_point_count():
    """Test requirement: Must reject datasets with != 150 points per cycle"""
    mock_data = create_mock_dataset(points_per_cycle=149)
    
    with pytest.raises(ValidationError, match="150 points"):
        validator.validate_phase_data(mock_data)
```

#### Code Agent Isolation
**Interface-Contract Implementation**:
- Implement methods based on interface specifications only
- Optimize for performance within specified constraints
- Handle errors according to contract requirements
- Document assumptions for integration clarity

**Quality Assurance Without Test Inspection**:
```python
# Code Agent implements to contract specifications
def validate_phase_data(self, dataframe):
    """Implementation follows interface contract exactly"""
    if not self._has_required_columns(dataframe):
        raise ValidationError("Missing required columns")
    
    if not self._verify_point_count(dataframe):
        raise ValidationError("Each cycle must have exactly 150 points")
    
    return self._generate_validation_result(dataframe)
```

#### Integration Agent Coordination
**External Test and Code Validation**:
- Execute tests without modifying either test or code implementations
- Provide systematic feedback for interface or behavior mismatches
- Coordinate resolution between Test and Code agents
- Validate successful integration before deployment

**Multi-Stream Integration Management**:
- Track multiple parallel development streams
- Coordinate integration timing and dependencies
- Manage conflict resolution between competing implementations
- Ensure quality standards across all integrated components

### Orchestration Testing Procedures

#### Agent Handoff Validation
- **Test-to-Integration Handoff**: Verify test completeness and executability
- **Code-to-Integration Handoff**: Validate interface compliance and contract adherence
- **Integration-to-Deployment**: Confirm successful test passage and performance validation

#### Communication Protocol Verification
- **Requirements Translation**: Ensure Test Agent receives complete behavioral specifications
- **Interface Documentation**: Verify Code Agent has precise implementation contracts
- **Feedback Loops**: Validate Integration Agent can provide effective debugging information

#### Multi-Stream Integration Testing
- **Parallel Development**: Test coordination of simultaneous agent work streams
- **Dependency Management**: Verify proper handling of inter-component dependencies
- **Conflict Resolution**: Test systematic resolution of integration conflicts

#### Success Validation Framework
- **Independent Development**: Verify agents can work effectively without cross-contamination
- **Integration Quality**: Ensure combined work meets all quality standards
- **Systematic Debugging**: Validate debugging process resolves issues efficiently
- **Performance Consistency**: Confirm integrated system meets all performance requirements
