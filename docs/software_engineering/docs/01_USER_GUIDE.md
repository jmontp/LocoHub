## üéØ User Population Analysis

!!! abstract "**90/9/1 Split Strategy**"
    Our phased approach serves users based on their contribution to data quality:
    
    - **üìä Dataset Consumers (90%):** Graduate students, clinical researchers, biomechanics engineers, sports scientists
    - **üîß Dataset Contributors (9%):** Dataset curators (programmers + biomechanical validation)
    - **‚öôÔ∏è System Administrators (1%):** Release managers, infrastructure maintainers

!!! success "**Current Development Focus**"
    **Phase 1** targets the 9% + 1% to establish validation infrastructure before building consumer tools for the 90%.
    
    **Why?** Quality-first approach - fewer high-quality datasets preferred over many questionable ones.
