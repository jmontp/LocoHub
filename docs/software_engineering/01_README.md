## File Index with Purpose

**Immediate Developer Needs:**
- `02_entry_points_reference.md` - Complete catalog of CLI tools by user role and priority
- `03_interface_standards.md` - CLI patterns, error codes, and configuration standards

**Requirements & User Focus:**
- `04_user_stories_acceptance_criteria.md` - User stories with acceptance criteria for testing
- `05_user_research_insights.md` - User population analysis and development priorities  
- `06_user_journey_maps.md` - User workflows with sequence diagrams

**Architecture (C4 Model Progression):**
- `07_c4_context.md` - System boundaries and external user interactions
- `08_c4_container.md` - Container architecture (current and future phases)
- `09_c4_component.md` - Internal component structure with data flow patterns
- `10_c4_code.md` - Detailed interface specifications (split into 3 focused files)

**Technical Implementation:**
