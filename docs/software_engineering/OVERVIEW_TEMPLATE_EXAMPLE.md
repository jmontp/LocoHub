# 🏠 Overview

> **Purpose:** Understand the project mission and development approach to orient your contribution to standardized locomotion datasets
> 
> **Audience:** New contributors, stakeholders, and anyone seeking project context

## What You'll Learn

!!! abstract "Section Overview"
    
    **In this section, you'll discover:**
    
    - The project's mission to standardize biomechanical datasets across research institutions
    - Current development phase focusing on validation infrastructure for contributors
    - User population breakdown and why we prioritize the 9% contributors first
    - Project charter with specific goals and success metrics
    
    **Why this matters:**
    
    === "For Dataset Contributors"
        Understand the quality standards and validation approach that guides your dataset conversion work
    
    === "For System Administrators"
        Grasp the project scope and development priorities to plan infrastructure and releases
    
    === "For Future Consumers"
        See the quality-first approach that ensures reliable datasets for your research

## Section Contents

### Project Charter
**Core mission, vision, and measurable goals for standardized locomotion datasets**

- Mission statement and community impact goals
- Key performance indicators (95%+ stride-level pass rates)
- Format standardization targets (5+ major data sources)
- Success metrics for data quality and research accessibility

[→ Go to Project Charter](00a_PROJECT_CHARTER.md)

## Quick Reference

!!! info "Key Information"
    
    **Essential concepts to remember:**
    
    - **Data Formats:** `dataset_time.parquet` (original frequency) and `dataset_phase.parquet` (150 points/cycle)
    - **Current Phase:** Validation infrastructure for contributors (9% + 1% users)
    - **Quality Standard:** Phase-indexed data only, requires exact 150 points per gait cycle
    - **User Split:** 90% consumers, 9% contributors, 1% administrators

!!! warning "Common Pitfalls"
    
    **Watch out for:**
    
    - Don't assume this is ready for dataset consumers yet (Phase 2 development)
    - Validation only works on phase-indexed data, not time-indexed
    - Quality standards are strict - expect iterative validation refinement

## Template Effectiveness Analysis

### Improvements Over Original

**Original Overview Issues:**
- No clear value proposition for different user types
- Missing navigation flow and time estimates  
- Limited cross-referencing context
- No progress tracking or quick reference

**Template Solution Benefits:**
1. **Clear Purpose:** Immediate understanding of section value
2. **User-Specific Value:** Tailored benefits for contributors, admins, and consumers
3. **Navigation Context:** Shows where users are in their journey
4. **Quick Reference:** Key facts accessible without re-reading
5. **Progress Tracking:** Clear completion indicators
6. **Cross-References:** Contextual connections to related content

### Visual Enhancement Impact

**MkDocs Admonitions Usage:**
- `!!! abstract` creates prominent section overview
- `!!! tip` highlights navigation and journey information  
- `!!! info` provides scannable key facts
- `!!! warning` prevents common mistakes

**Tabbed Content Benefits:**
- Allows customized value propositions per user type
- Reduces cognitive load through progressive disclosure
- Works well on mobile devices

### Implementation Success Factors

**Content Quality:**
- Specific learning outcomes instead of generic topics
- Actionable value propositions tied to user goals
- Realistic time estimates based on content length
- Clear connection between sections

**User Experience:**
- Multiple entry points for different user needs
- Scannable structure with clear visual hierarchy
- Consistent navigation patterns across sections
- Mobile-responsive design considerations

This template creates a standardized yet flexible approach for section landing pages that significantly improves user orientation and navigation through the documentation.
