## Architecture Traceability

### Requirements-to-Architecture Mapping

**Primary Validation Infrastructure (F1)**:
- **Context Level**: Dataset Contributors workflow in [Document 11](11_c4_context.md)
- **Container Level**: Validation Engine container in [Document 12](12_c4_container.md)
- **Component Level**: PhaseValidator, ValidationSpecManager components in [Document 13](13_c4_component.md)
- **Implementation**: validation_dataset_report.py as primary tool

**Quality-First Architecture Strategy**:
- **10% contributor effort** (F1-F4) **enables 90% consumer success** (future F5-F6)
- **Validation infrastructure** serves as foundation for all consumer-facing features
- **Phased development** approach aligns with user population priorities from [Context Architecture (11)](11_c4_context.md)

### Workflow-Architecture Integration

**From [Document 06 Workflows](06_sequence_workflows.md) to Architecture**:
- **Sequence 1**: Maps to Conversion Scripts + Validation Engine containers
- **Sequences 2A/2B**: Maps to SpecificationManager + Validation Engine integration
- **Sequence 3**: Maps directly to primary validation_dataset_report.py container
- **Sequence 4**: Maps to future administrative containers (Phase 2-3)

**Container Priority** (from workflows analysis):
1. **Validation Engine** - Used by all current workflows
2. **SpecificationManager** - Critical for workflows 2A/2B
3. **Shared Library** - Supporting infrastructure
4. **Conversion Scripts** - Supporting tools for workflow 1
