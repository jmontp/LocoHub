# Practical Validation Implementation Plan

**Realistic sub-agent strategy that acknowledges domain complexity and tight coupling.**

## Core Problems with Traditional Approaches

### **Why Pure Parallel Development Fails:**
1. **Domain Knowledge Barrier**: Biomechanical validation requires deep understanding that can't be abstracted into simple interfaces
2. **Interface Evolution**: Real requirements emerge during implementation - pre-defined interfaces become obsolete
3. **Tight Coupling Reality**: SpecificationManager and PhaseValidator must co-evolve; they can't be developed independently
4. **Integration Hell**: Component boundaries don't align with actual data flow and validation logic
5. **Test Data Dependency**: All components need the same complex test datasets and domain knowledge

### **Why Test-First Struggles Here:**
- **Unknown unknowns**: Can't write tests for validation edge cases we haven't discovered yet
- **Domain complexity**: Biomechanical validation has nuanced requirements that emerge through implementation
- **Real data needed**: Tests require actual validation specs and datasets, not synthetic examples

## Better Strategy: Evolutionary Development with Parallel Learning

### **Core Principle: Working Software Over Perfect Interfaces**
Build working prototypes that demonstrate value, then refactor with learned interfaces.

## Phase 0: Foundation & Exploration (Week 1)

### **Sub-Agent A: Domain Research & Test Infrastructure**
**Goal**: Create shared foundation that enables all other work

**Deliverables**:
1. **Test Data Pipeline**: 
   - Load existing validation specs (`validation_expectations_*.md`)
   - Create test datasets with known validation patterns
   - Set up test data fixtures for all sub-agents
   
2. **Domain Knowledge Documentation**:
   - Document current validation logic from existing code
   - Map current file structure and dependencies
   - Identify validation edge cases and biomechanical constraints
   
3. **Shared Test Infrastructure**:
   - Common test utilities and fixtures
   - Mock data generators for different scenarios
   - Integration test harness for end-to-end workflows

**Success Criteria**: Other sub-agents can use shared test data and understand current validation approach

## Phase 1: Vertical Slice Implementation (Weeks 2-3)

### **Single Complete Workflow: Walking Task Validation**
Instead of building components, build one complete workflow that works end-to-end.

### **Sub-Agent B: Walking Validation Prototype**
**Goal**: Complete walking validation from spec to report

**Approach**: Build the simplest possible working solution
```python
# Not beautiful, but working
def validate_walking_dataset(file_path: str) -> str:
    """Complete walking validation workflow. Returns markdown report path."""
    # 1. Load and parse walking validation specs
    # 2. Load dataset and check basic structure  
    # 3. Filter strides using walking-specific ranges
    # 4. Generate basic validation report
    # 5. Return report path
```

**Test Strategy**: 
- End-to-end test with real walking dataset
- Known validation failures and expected behavior
- Report generation and content verification

**Deliverables**:
- Working walking validation CLI: `python validate_walking.py dataset.parquet`
- Generates markdown report with pass/fail status
- Identifies which validation spec components are needed

### **Sub-Agent C: Multi-Task Extension Research**
**Goal**: Understand what changes for other tasks (running, stairs, etc.)

**Approach**: Parallel learning while Sub-Agent B builds walking prototype
1. **Task Variation Analysis**: How do validation ranges differ across tasks?
2. **Edge Case Discovery**: What validation challenges exist for non-walking tasks?
3. **Interface Requirements**: What would a multi-task validator need to look like?
4. **Performance Analysis**: How does validation scale with multiple tasks?

**Deliverables**:
- Task comparison analysis
- Interface requirements for multi-task support
- Performance benchmarks and scalability concerns
- Edge case documentation

## Phase 2: Interface Discovery & Refactoring (Week 4)

### **Sub-Agent D: Interface Extraction**
**Goal**: Extract learned interfaces from working walking prototype

**Approach**: Refactor working code to discover natural component boundaries
1. **Extract SpecificationManager**: Pull out spec parsing logic from walking prototype
2. **Extract ValidationEngine**: Pull out core validation logic  
3. **Extract ReportGenerator**: Pull out report generation
4. **Define Real Interfaces**: Based on actual usage, not theoretical design

**Test Strategy**: 
- Ensure refactored components still pass original walking tests
- Add unit tests for extracted components
- Verify interface contracts match actual usage

### **Sub-Agent E: Multi-Task Implementation**
**Goal**: Extend validated interfaces to handle multiple tasks

**Approach**: Use interfaces discovered by Sub-Agent D
1. **Extend SpecificationManager**: Handle multiple task specifications
2. **Extend ValidationEngine**: Multi-task validation logic
3. **Update CLI**: Generic validation tool that handles any task

**Test Strategy**:
- Test with running, stair climbing tasks
- Verify walking tests still pass
- Add comprehensive multi-task integration tests

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)

### **Sub-Agent F: Specification Management Tools**
**Goal**: Build tools for editing and managing validation specs

**Approach**: Use proven SpecificationManager interface
1. **Manual Editing CLI**: `validation_manual_tune_spec.py`
2. **Staging Workflow**: Safe preview and rollback
3. **Change Impact Analysis**: Show affected datasets

### **Sub-Agent G: Phase Conversion Pipeline**  
**Goal**: Build time-to-phase conversion with validation

**Approach**: Integrate with proven ValidationEngine
1. **Conversion Logic**: Time-to-phase algorithm
2. **Validation Integration**: Auto-validate converted datasets
3. **CLI Tool**: `conversion_generate_phase_dataset.py`

### **Sub-Agent H: Statistical Auto-Tuning**
**Goal**: Build statistical range optimization

**Approach**: Use proven interfaces and real dataset analysis
1. **Statistical Methods**: Percentile, IQR, robust methods
2. **Impact Preview**: Show validation changes before applying
3. **Integration**: Use staging workflow from Sub-Agent F

## Coordination Protocol

### **Shared Context Management**
- **Living Documentation**: Each sub-agent updates shared knowledge base
- **Interface Evolution**: Document interface changes and rationale
- **Test Data Stewardship**: Sub-Agent A maintains test infrastructure

### **Integration Points**
- **Weekly Integration**: Ensure working software integrates correctly
- **Interface Reviews**: Validate extracted interfaces match real usage
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track validation speed and memory usage

### **Quality Gates**
1. **Working Software**: Every phase produces working CLI tools
2. **Real Data Testing**: All tools work with actual datasets
3. **Performance Standards**: <30s validation for typical datasets
4. **User Value**: Each tool solves actual user problems

## Why This Approach Works

### **Evolutionary Design**
- Interfaces emerge from real usage, not theoretical design
- Domain complexity is discovered through implementation
- Refactoring happens with working software, reducing risk

### **Parallel Learning**
- Multiple sub-agents can research different aspects simultaneously
- Knowledge sharing prevents duplicate domain discovery
- Working prototypes inform interface design

### **Real Value Delivery**
- Users get working tools at each phase
- Early feedback identifies missing requirements
- Reduces risk of building wrong abstractions

### **Manageable Complexity**
- One complete workflow first, then extend
- Shared infrastructure reduces coordination overhead  
- Interface evolution is planned and documented

## Success Metrics

**Phase 1**: Working walking validation CLI that passes real dataset tests
**Phase 2**: Multi-task validation with clean, tested interfaces
**Phase 3**: Complete validation toolkit with advanced features

**Overall**: User can validate any locomotion dataset and manage validation specifications effectively.

This approach acknowledges the reality of domain complexity while enabling parallel development through evolutionary design and shared learning.
