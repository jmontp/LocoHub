## Implementation Priority

**Critical:**
- Validation scaffolding infrastructure - Cannot assess dataset quality without this
- `validate_phase_data.py` - Core validation functionality
- `validate_time_data.py` - Core validation functionality  
- Conversion script examples and templates - Cannot guide community contributions without these

**High:**
