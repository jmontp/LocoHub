# Content Organization Strategy

**Created: 2025-06-19 with user permission**  
**Purpose: Organize documentation to match actual system capabilities**  

**Intent:** Design content structure that acknowledges implementation limitations, separates working features from planned ones, and creates clear paths for users to accomplish what's actually possible today.

## Content Organization Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Reality-First Organization**: Structure content around what users can actually accomplish
2. **Capability Transparency**: Clear distinction between working and planned features
3. **Success-Path Optimization**: Guide users to workflows that will succeed
4. **Implementation-Driven Hierarchy**: Organize by actual code structure and tool functionality
5. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with working basics, advance to complex features

### Primary Content Categories

**Based on Actual System Analysis:**

```

├── Verified Library APIs  
├── Available Datasets
├── Quality Standards
└── Working Workflows

PARTIALLY WORKING (Use with Caution)
├── Advanced Features
├── Custom Workflows
├── Integration Examples
└── Experimental Tools

PLANNED FEATURES (Future)

└── Community Features
```

## Content Hierarchy Design

### Tier 1: Core Working Features (80% of users)

**Primary Navigation Structure:**

#### 1. Getting Started (Reality-Based)
```
Getting Started/
├── environment_setup.md                    # ✅ Verified conda/pip requirements
├── validate_your_first_dataset.md          # ✅ Working CLI workflow
├── understanding_validation_reports.md     # ✅ Based on actual report format
└── common_issues_and_solutions.md          # ✅ Real error messages and fixes
```

**Content Strategy:**
- **Start with working tools** - validate_phase_dataset.py as entry point
- **Real examples** - Use actual datasets (umich_2021_phase.parquet)
- **Immediate success** - Focus on tasks users can complete in 15 minutes
- **Clear expectations** - State what users will accomplish

#### 2. CLI Tools Reference (Professional Documentation)
```

    ├── optimize_validation_ranges.md       # ✅ Auto-tuning workflow
    └── update_validation_ranges.md         # ✅ Manual range adjustment
```

**Content Strategy:**
- **Tool-centric organization** - Match actual CLI script structure
- **Complete examples** - Every command shown with real parameters
- **Professional depth** - Cover all features, not just basics
- **Cross-references** - Link related tools in workflows

#### 3. LocomotionData Library (Comprehensive API)

## Content Status Classification System

### Status Indicators

**Use clear visual indicators throughout documentation:**

- **✅ WORKING** - Fully functional, tested, ready for production use
- **⚠️ LIMITED** - Basic functionality works, advanced features may be incomplete
- **🧪 EXPERIMENTAL** - Works but limited testing, use with caution
- **📋 PLANNED** - Documented architecture but not yet implemented
- **❌ BROKEN** - Known issues or incomplete implementation

### Content Templates

**Template for Working Features:**
```markdown
# Feature Name ✅ WORKING

## Quick Start (2-minute success)
[Minimal working example]

## Complete Reference
[All options and parameters]

## Common Use Cases
[Real-world examples]

## Troubleshooting

```

## Information Architecture Patterns

### Pattern 1: Tool-First Navigation

**Organize by CLI Tools (Primary Path):**
```
validate-phase-dataset → understand-reports → tune-validation → create-release
```

**Benefits:**
- Matches actual user workflow
- Every step is functional
- Clear progression path
- Builds on working foundation

### Pattern 2: Use-Case Navigation

**Organize by User Goals (Secondary Path):**
```
I want to... → Validate Data Quality → Use CLI Tool X → Follow Complete Workflow
```

**Benefits:**
- Goal-oriented user experience
- Reduces tool discovery time
- Connects multiple tools for complex tasks
- Suitable for all skill levels

### Pattern 3: Reference Navigation

**Organize by Component Type (Expert Path):**
```
Libraries → Validation System → Dataset Standards → Release Management
```

**Benefits:**
- Comprehensive coverage
- Professional depth
- API documentation style
- Suitable for integration work

## Content Maintenance Strategy

### Version Control by Implementation Status

**Working Content (High Maintenance Priority):**
- Update with every CLI tool change
- Verify examples with each release
- Test all code snippets automatically
- Monitor user feedback closely

**Limited Content (Medium Priority):**
- Update when features stabilize
- Mark clearly when functionality changes
- Provide migration guides when needed
- Regular status review

**Planned Content (Low Priority):**
- Update architecture when designs change
- Keep roadmap current
- Remove when plans change significantly
- Focus on intention over implementation

### Quality Assurance Process

**For Working Features:**
1. **Code Verification** - All examples must execute successfully
2. **User Testing** - New users should complete workflows without assistance  
3. **Error Documentation** - Common failure modes documented with solutions
4. **Regular Review** - Monthly verification of all examples

**For Limited Features:**
1. **Capability Documentation** - Clear boundaries of what works
2. **Limitation Transparency** - Honest assessment of gaps
3. **Workaround Validation** - Alternative approaches tested
4. **Progress Tracking** - Regular status updates

## Search and Discovery Optimization

### Content Discoverability

**Primary Entry Points:**
1. **Problem-Solving Search** - "How do I validate my dataset?"
2. **Tool-Based Search** - "validate_phase_dataset.py documentation"
3. **Workflow Search** - "dataset conversion workflow"
4. **Error-Resolution Search** - "validation failure troubleshooting"

**Content Tagging Strategy:**
- **Capability Level**: working, limited, experimental, planned
- **User Type**: contributor, analyst, administrator, student
- **Tool Category**: cli, library, validation, visualization
- **Complexity Level**: beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert

### Content Cross-Linking

**Strategic Link Patterns:**
1. **CLI Tools → Library Functions** - Show integration opportunities
2. **Examples → Troubleshooting** - Connect success and failure paths
3. **Basic → Advanced** - Progressive skill building
4. **Working → Planned** - Future capability awareness
