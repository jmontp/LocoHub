# Georgia Tech 2021

## Overview

**Short Code**: GT21  
**Year**: 2019  
**Institution**: Georgia Institute of Technology — EPIC Lab  

Full phase-normalized locomotion dataset with ramps, stairs, and level walking for 22 able-bodied adults prior to stride filtering.

## Dataset Information

### Subjects and Tasks
- **Number of Subjects**: 22
- **Tasks Included**: level_walking, incline_walking, decline_walking, stair_ascent, stair_descent

### Data Structure
- **Format**: Phase-normalized (150 points per gait cycle)
- **Sampling**: Phase-indexed from 0-100%
- **Variables**: Standard biomechanical naming convention

## Validation Results

### Summary

**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL (89.2% valid)  
**Total Strides**: 20,988  
**Passing Strides**: 18,724  

### Task Breakdown

| Task | Pass Rate | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| decline_walking | 91.0% | 633 stride failures across 20 features |
| incline_walking | 95.5% | 142 stride failures across 17 features |
| level_walking | 81.6% | 3,419 stride failures across 20 features |
| stair_ascent | 90.4% | 55 stride failures across 12 features |
| stair_descent | 97.0% | 18 stride failures across 11 features |

## Collection Details

### Protocol
Captured with Vicon motion capture, instrumented ramp and stairs, processed through OpenSim inverse dynamics.

### Processing Notes
Raw dataset includes every recorded stride; pair with filtered version for validated subset.
