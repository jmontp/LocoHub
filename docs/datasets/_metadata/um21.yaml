description: "Human locomotion involves continuously variable activities including\
  \ walking, running, and stair climbing over a range of speeds and inclinations as\
  \ well as sit-stand, walk-run, and walk-stairs transitions. Understanding the kinematics\
  \ and kinetics of the lower limbs during continuously varying locomotion is fundamental\
  \ to developing robotic prostheses and exoskeletons that assist in community ambulation.\
  \ However, available datasets on human locomotion neglect transitions between activities\
  \ and/or continuous variations in speed and inclination during these activities.\
  \ This data paper reports a new dataset that includes the lower-limb kinematics\
  \ and kinetics of ten able-bodied participants walking at multiple inclines (\xB1\
  0\xB0; 5\xB0 and 10\xB0) and speeds (0.8\u2009m/s; 1\u2009m/s; 1.2\u2009m/s), running\
  \ at multiple speeds (1.8\u2009m/s; 2\u2009m/s; 2.2\u2009m/s and 2.4\u2009m/s),\
  \ walking and running with constant acceleration (\xB10.2; 0.5), and stair ascent/descent\
  \ with multiple stair inclines (20\xB0; 25\xB0; 30\xB0 and 35\xB0). This dataset\
  \ also includes sit-stand transitions, walk-run transitions, and walk-stairs transitions.\
  \ Data were recorded by a Vicon motion capture system and, for applicable tasks,\
  \ a Bertec instrumented treadmill."
