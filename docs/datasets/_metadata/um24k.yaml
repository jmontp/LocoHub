description: 'Dataset from "A Versatile Knee Exoskeleton Mitigates Quadriceps Fatigue

  in Lifting, Lowering, and Carrying Tasks" (Science Robotics 2024). Contains

  ensemble-averaged biomechanical data from 10 able-bodied adults performing

  lifting-lowering-carrying (LLC) tasks while wearing a bilateral knee exoskeleton.

  Includes knee kinematics, segment angles, exoskeleton torque, and ground reaction
  forces.

protocol: 'Data collected from 10 able-bodied participants performing fatiguing and

  non-fatiguing lifting-lowering-carrying (LLC) tasks with a bilateral knee exoskeleton.

  Tasks include squat lift-lower, level walking, stair ascent/descent (7 inch steps),

  and ramp ascent/descent (15 degrees). Data is ensemble-averaged across subjects

  and cycles, normalized to 0-100% task cycle.

  '
notes: 'Source data is already ensemble-averaged (101 points per cycle), resampled

  to 150 points for standardized format. Only knee angle available (no hip/ankle).

  Exoskeleton torque stored in custom column (exo_torque_knee_ipsi_Nm). GRF is

  body-weight normalized. Data repository: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.z34tmpgks
