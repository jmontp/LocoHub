description: We introduce a novel dataset containing 3-dimensional biomechanical and
  wearable sensor data from 22 able-bodied adults for multiple locomotion modes (level-ground/treadmill
  walking, stair ascent/descent, and ramp ascent/descent) and multiple terrain conditions
  of each mode (walking speed, stair height, and ramp inclination). In this paper,
  we present the data collection methods, explain the structure of the open dataset,
  and report the sensor data along with the kinematic and kinetic profiles of joint
  biomechanics as a function of the gait phase. This dataset offers a comprehensive
  source of locomotion information for the same set of subjects to motivate applications
  in locomotion recognition, developments in robotic assistive devices, and improvement
  of biomimetic controllers that better adapt to terrain conditions. With such a dataset,
  models for these applications can be either subject-dependent or subject-independent,
  allowing greater flexibility for researchers to advance the field.
