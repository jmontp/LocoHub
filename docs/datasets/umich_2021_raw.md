# University of Michigan 2021

## Overview

**Short Code**: UM22  
**Year**: 2018  
**Institution**: University of Michigan — Locomotor Control Systems Laboratory  

Comprehensive treadmill locomotion dataset with multiple speeds, inclines, and EMG for 10 able-bodied adults before stride filtering.

## Dataset Information

### Subjects and Tasks
- **Number of Subjects**: 10
- **Tasks Included**: level_walking, incline_walking, decline_walking, run, sit_to_stand, stand_to_sit

### Data Structure
- **Format**: Phase-normalized (150 points per gait cycle)
- **Sampling**: Phase-indexed from 0-100%
- **Variables**: Standard biomechanical naming convention

**Passing Strides**: 10,698  

### Task Breakdown

| Task | Pass Rate | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| level_walking | 95.9% | 469 stride failures across 20 features |
| incline_walking | 87.0% | 897 stride failures across 21 features |
| decline_walking | 86.2% | 736 stride failures across 19 features |
| run | — | Included in dataset but not assessed in quick summary |
| sit_to_stand | — | Included in dataset but not assessed in quick summary |
| stand_to_sit | — | Included in dataset but not assessed in quick summary |

## Collection Details

### Protocol
Captured on an instrumented Bertec treadmill with Vicon motion capture and EMG, then processed through Visual3D and phase normalized to 150 points.

### Processing Notes
Raw dataset includes every stride; see filtered version for validation-pass subset.
