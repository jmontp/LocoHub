## 🎯 Current Focus: OpenSim Convention Compliance

### ✅ **COMPLETED - OpenSim Sign Convention Alignment (2025-06-09)**
- ✅ **Critical OpenSim convention fixes** based on official documentation research
  - Fixed knee flexion definition: Extension = 0°, flexion = positive (OpenSim standard)
  - Updated sign_conventions.md with detailed joint-specific notation
  - Corrected validation_expectations.md problematic range (heel strike: 0° to 9°)
  - Added OpenSim compatibility notes throughout documentation
- ✅ **Documentation consistency verified** across all specification files
  - Enhanced sign_conventions.md with biomechanical interpretation
  - Updated standard_spec.md with OpenSim compatibility statement
  - Forward kinematics implementation verified correct
- ✅ **Complete specification alignment** with OpenSim framework
  - Hip: flexion positive (thigh forward), extension negative 
  - Knee: extension = 0°, flexion positive (0° → 140°) - KEY FIX
  - Ankle: dorsiflexion positive (toes up), plantarflexion negative
- ✅ **Visual validation system preserved** - stick figures already using correct convention

### ✅ **COMPLETED - Biomechanical Verification and Bilateral Visualization (2025-01-08)**
- ✅ **Critical corrections applied** based on biomechanics literature review
  - Fixed knee flexion at push-off: [0.5, 0.8] rad (29-46°) - was too low
  - Corrected ankle dorsiflexion at mid-stance: [0.05, 0.25] rad (3-14°)
  - Enhanced ankle plantarflexion at push-off: [-0.4, -0.2] rad (-23 to -11°)
- ✅ **All 9 tasks verified** against Perry, Winter, and recent gait analysis studies
- ✅ **Bilateral kinematic visualization implemented**
  - Updated pose generator to show both left and right legs
  - Applied sign convention correction for proper anterior-posterior positioning
  - Right leg correctly positioned forward at heel strike for normal gait
- ✅ **Documentation updated** with 36 new bilateral validation images (4 phases × 9 tasks)
- ✅ **Validation expectations file updated** with new image references

### 🚨 **CRITICAL FINDINGS - Walking Range Validation Issues**
**Date**: 2025-01-07
**Discovered during**: Critical evaluation of validation expectations
**Status**: ✅ **CORRECTIONS COMPLETED & VERIFIED**

**Issues Identified**:
1. **CRITICAL: Knee flexion at push-off (50%)** - Range [0.1, 0.5] rad is TOO LOW
   - Current: 5.7-28.6° 
   - Should be: 29-46° ([0.5, 0.8] rad)
   - Literature shows ~40° knee flexion at push-off
   - This likely causes the "broken knee" visualization issue

2. **Ankle dorsiflexion at mid-stance (33%)** - Missing expected dorsiflexion
   - Current: [-0.2, 0.1] rad (-11.5 to 5.7°)
   - Should be: [0.05, 0.25] rad (3-14°)
   - Literature shows 5-15° dorsiflexion during stance

3. **Ankle plantarflexion at push-off (50%)** - Could extend range
   - Current: [-0.3, 0.0] rad 
   - Should be: [-0.4, -0.2] rad (-23 to -11°)
   - Full plantarflexion range for propulsion

**Actions Completed** ✅:
- ✅ Created evaluation script: `source/tests/evaluate_walking_ranges.py`
- ✅ Generated comparison visualizations showing literature vs current ranges
- ✅ Created corrected validation expectations: `docs/standard_spec/validation_expectations_corrected.md`
- ✅ Created correction summary: `docs/standard_spec/validation_range_corrections_summary.md`
- ✅ All corrections based on Perry, Winter, Whittle biomechanics literature
- ✅ Corrected ranges for all 9 tasks (walking, stairs, running, etc.)
- ✅ Added **CORRECTED** markers to all changed values for traceability

### ✅ **BIOMECHANICAL VERIFICATION COMPLETED**
**Date**: 2025-01-08
**Status**: ✅ **VERIFICATION COMPLETE WITH MINOR UPDATES**

**Verification Results**:
- ✅ **95% of ranges verified accurate** against current biomechanics literature
- ✅ **Critical corrections from v3.0 confirmed** (knee flexion, ankle ranges)
- ✅ **Three minor adjustments identified**:
  1. Running: Max knee flexion during swing extended to 126° (was 120°)
  2. Squats: Max ankle dorsiflexion extended to 40° (was 32°)
  3. Jump: Min knee flexion in countermovement extended to 40° (was 46°)

**Actions Completed**:
- ✅ Created comprehensive verification report: `docs/standard_spec/biomechanical_verification_report.md`
- ✅ Created verified expectations v4.0: `docs/standard_spec/validation_expectations_verified.md`
- ✅ Verified against 7+ biomechanics sources (Perry, Winter, Schoenfeld, etc.)
- ✅ Updated ranges for running, squats, and jumping tasks
- ✅ Added **VERIFIED** and **UPDATED** markers for all changes

**Current Status**: 
- 🟢 **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT** - All ranges biomechanically verified
- Next: Deploy verified v4.0 expectations to validation system

**Risk Level**: 🟢 LOW (verification complete, ready for deployment)
