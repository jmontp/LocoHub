# Project Management - Locomotion Data Standardization

## 📋 Project Overview

**Goal**: Test and validate the intuitive biomechanical validation system to ensure it works correctly and meets specifications.

**Current Status**: 🚀 **Testing Phase - Intuitive Validation System**
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-06
**Next Review**: Weekly progress updates

---

## 🎯 Current Focus: Close the Loop with Testing

### ✅ **COMPLETED - Intuitive Validation System**
- ✅ Phase-based validation using clinical expectations
- ✅ Independent task descriptions (no baseline inheritance)
- ✅ Step-level error identification and debugging
- ✅ Comprehensive debugging reports with fix suggestions
- ✅ Language model integration capabilities

### 🚀 **ACTIVE GOAL: Testing & Validation**

#### Step 1: Standard Spec Compliance (INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION DONE)
**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL
**Timeline**: This week
**Status**: ✅ Initial Implementation Complete, Needs Refinement

**Objectives**:
- [x] **Create spec compliance test suite** 
  - ✅ Variable naming convention compliance (`<joint>_<motion>_<measurement>_<side>_<unit>`)
  - ✅ Phase calculation expectations (0-100%, 150 points/cycle)
  - ✅ Sign convention adherence (hip extension +, knee extension +, ankle dorsiflexion +)
  - ✅ Test suite with generated compliant data (100% pass rate)

- [ ] **Refinement and Real-World Testing**
  - Memory-efficient testing for large datasets (5.7GB GTech files)
  - Visual validation and report generation
  - Testing of test suite reliability

- [ ] **Integration with Existing Systems**
  - Compare intuitive validation outputs with traditional validation
  - Ensure no conflicts between validation approaches
  - Test integration with existing pipeline

**Deliverables**:
- [x] Spec compliance test suite (initial implementation)
- [ ] GTech 2023 compliance analysis (needs memory optimization)
- [ ] Visual validation reports
- [ ] Test suite reliability validation

**Current Blockers**: None identified
**Risk Level**: 🟡 MEDIUM (potential range accuracy issues)

## 🚨 **Current Risks & Mitigation**

### Active Risks:
1. **Biomechanical Range Accuracy**
   - *Risk*: Expected ranges may not match published literature exactly
   - *Mitigation*: Systematic literature review and expert consultation
   - *Status*: Monitoring during testing

2. **Spec Interpretation**
   - *Risk*: Misunderstanding of standard specification requirements
   - *Mitigation*: Careful review of spec documents, test with examples
   - *Status*: Active focus
