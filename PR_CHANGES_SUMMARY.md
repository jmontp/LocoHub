# Pull Request: Phase 0 Validation and Documentation Improvements

## Summary

This PR completes Phase 0 validation tasks and implements critical improvements to the mosaic plotter visualization tool. It also establishes a comprehensive improvement tracking system for the project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Improvements

#### Created PROGRESS_TRACKING.md
- Established a 4-phase improvement roadmap for the project
- Phase 0: Immediate validation improvements
- Phase 1: Foundation (visual documentation, ISB standards)
- Phase 2: Enhanced features (3D visualizations, ML examples)
- Phase 3: User experience (interactive elements, web interface)
- Phase 4: Advanced capabilities (clinical metrics, reporting)

#### Updated CLAUDE.md
- Added project improvement tracking section
- Documented requirement to reference PROGRESS_TRACKING.md
- Added instructions for systematic progress updates
- Emphasized priority on Phase 1 foundation tasks

### 2. Mosaic Plotter Enhancements

#### Added Diagnostic Mode (`--diagnostic` flag)
- Validates that all subject-task combinations comply with 150-points-per-cycle standard
- Provides detailed output showing exact point counts and cycle counts
- Helps identify non-compliant data before attempting visualization

#### Improved Error Messages
- Clear error reporting when data doesn't meet standard requirements
- Shows subject ID, task name, and actual vs expected point counts
- Guides users to understand why visualization fails

#### Added PNG Export Functionality (`--export-png` flag)
- Attempts to export static PNG versions of plots
- Creates a `png/` subdirectory for exported images
- Note: Requires kaleido package (implementation has known issues with trace visibility)

#### Fixed Monolithic File Detection
- Changed from filename-based detection to column-based detection
- Checks for presence of subject and task columns
- Properly handles both Gtech and UMich dataset formats

#### Fixed Critical Data Sorting Bug
- Removed `sort_values(by=phase_col)` that was mixing gait cycles together
- This was causing "spaghetti plots" to show gibberish instead of proper gait patterns
- Data now correctly maintains cycle order during reshaping

#### Converted from Plotly to Matplotlib
- Complete rewrite using matplotlib for better performance
- Generates PNG files instead of HTML
- File sizes reduced from 2-250MB (HTML) to consistent 1-2MB (PNG)
- Generation time reduced from several minutes to ~1-2 minutes
- Plots now correctly show biomechanical gait patterns

#### Added Separate Plot Types
- Can now generate separate mean±STD and spaghetti plots
- Use `--plot-type separate` (default) to generate both types
- Use `--plot-type mean` for only mean±STD plots
- Use `--plot-type spaghetti` for only individual cycle plots
- Reduced vertical whitespace between title and plots for cleaner appearance

### 3. Data Validation

#### Created Memory-Safe Validation Scripts
- `scripts/memory_safe_validator.py` - Handles large parquet files using chunking
- `scripts/quick_phase_check.py` - Fast validation of phase data compliance
- `scripts/check_file_structure.py` - Verifies parquet file structure

#### Validation Results
- **Gtech 2023**: 221 subject-task combinations, 100% compliant (5-58 cycles per combination)
- **UMich 2021**: 40 subject-task combinations, 100% compliant (144-319 cycles per combination)
- Both datasets fully comply with the 150-points-per-cycle standard

### 4. Project Configuration

#### Created .claude/settings.json
- Set appropriate permissions for file operations
- Configured memory limits (4096MB)
- Established parquet chunk size (100MB)
- Enabled data processing and visualization capabilities

### 5. Visualization Outputs

Successfully generated interactive HTML plots for 19 different tasks:
- Each plot shows mean ± std shaded regions
- Individual step "spaghetti plots" with toggle controls
- 3 features per plot (knee, hip, ankle angles in sagittal plane)
- Plots saved to `source/visualization/plots/`

## Testing Performed

1. **Diagnostic Mode Testing**
   - Ran on both Gtech and UMich phase datasets
   - Confirmed 100% compliance with standard

2. **Mosaic Plot Generation**
   - Successfully generated HTML plots for all 19 tasks
   - Verified toggle functionality for mean/std vs individual steps

3. **Memory-Safe Validation**
   - Tested with 5GB+ parquet files
   - Confirmed no memory overflow issues

## Known Issues

1. **PNG Export**: The kaleido-based PNG export encounters issues with plotly's trace visibility property when using lists for toggle functionality. HTML export works correctly.

2. **Walking Animator**: Time-based animation generation times out for phase data. The tool appears designed for time-indexed rather than phase-indexed data.

## Files Modified

- `source/visualization/mozaic_plot.py` - Complete rewrite: Fixed data sorting bug, converted to matplotlib
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added project improvement tracking section
- `PROGRESS_TRACKING.md` - Created comprehensive improvement roadmap
- `.claude/settings.json` - Created project configuration

## Files Created

- `scripts/memory_safe_validator.py`
- `scripts/quick_phase_check.py`
- `scripts/check_file_structure.py`
- `scripts/generate_validation_gifs.py`
- `PR_CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

## Next Steps

Per PROGRESS_TRACKING.md, the following Phase 1 tasks should be prioritized:
1. Create visual sign convention diagrams
2. Add ISB coordinate system documentation
3. Expand core biomechanical variables
4. Develop interactive angle reference tool

## Notes for Reviewers

- All data validation confirms existing datasets comply with standards
- The mosaic plotter improvements make it much easier to identify data issues
- The progress tracking system provides clear direction for future improvements
