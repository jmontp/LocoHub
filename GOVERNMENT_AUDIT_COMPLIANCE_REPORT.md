## TECHNICAL CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED

### 1. PANDAS/NUMPY COMPATIBILITY ISSUES

**Primary Blocker:**
```
TypeError: int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a real number, not '_NoValueType'
```

**Impact:**
- Prevented execution of data manipulation tests
- Blocked 3D array operation testing
- Limited statistical analysis coverage
- Prevented plotting function validation

**Environment Factors:**
- pandas version: Latest (potential compatibility issues)
- numpy version: Latest (potential compatibility issues)
- Python 3.12.3 environment constraints

### 2. COMPLEX DATA STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

**Challenges:**
- LocomotionData requires exact 150-point cycles
- Phase-indexed data validation complexity
- Multi-dimensional array operations sensitivity
- Subject/task data grouping requirements

### 3. MATPLOTLIB MOCKING COMPLEXITY

**Issues:**
- Complex subplot configuration testing
- Multi-axis plotting validation
- Dynamic figure generation
- Save/show functionality testing
